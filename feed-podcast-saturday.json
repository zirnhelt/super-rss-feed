Articles from local Cariboo news sources (mycariboonow.com, wltribune.com, quesnelobserver.com, 100milefreepress.net, cfjctoday.com) covering Cariboo community life should score 65-85. Score 50-79 for: BC provincial news directly affecting Cariboo communities, rural Canadian community stories closely paralleling Cariboo life, digital equity and rural internet broadly. Score 20-49 for: general BC news that may affect rural areas, broader rural Canada topics without specific Cariboo tie-in. Score 0-19 for: national/international news without Cariboo relevance, pure tech or entertainment with no community angle. Score 0-100 where 100 is a perfect thematic match.",
