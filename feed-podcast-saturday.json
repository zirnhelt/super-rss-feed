Articles from local Cariboo news sources (mycariboonow.com, wltribune.com, quesnelobserver.com, 100milefreepress.net, cfjctoday.com) covering Cariboo community life should score 65-85. Score 50-79 for: BC provincial news directly affecting Cariboo communities, rural Canadian community stories closely paralleling Cariboo life, digital equity and rural internet broadly.
