EC officials are concerned about the sale of illegal products, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddrg70pj1mo\"><ins>child sexual abuse material</ins></a>, as well as the potentially addictive design of its shopping experience. The Commission found fellow low-cost retailer Temu <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1913\"><ins>in violation</ins></a> of the Digital Services Act after a similar investigation last year.</p>\n<p>The probe is being opened under the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act\"><ins>Digital Services Act</ins></a>, a set of EU rules governing online services. The Commission will examine how Shein drives engagement with shoppers, including using a points and rewards system, and whether the company is properly mitigating the risk of addiction via these and other features.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Algorithmic recommendation systems are another point of contention, and the Commission will ask Shein to disclose how it suggests  products to users. It also says that the company must offer users a system that is not based on profiling.</p>\n<p>The Singapore-based company has faced a great deal of scrutiny in past years on a number of fronts, including its labor practices, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg7n1d85go\"><ins>materials sourcing</ins></a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-temu-and-more-face-complaints-alleging-gdpr-violations-in-eu-195115567.html\"><ins>data practices</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/what-is-stake-china-founded-e-commerce-giant-shein-eu-rule-looms-2024-06-19/\"><ins>IP infringement</ins></a>.

Algorithms have also been in focus, with the Commission recently launching a probe into how exactly <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-eu-wants-to-know-just-how-xs-recommendation-algorithm-works-161000963.html\"><ins>X's recommendation algorithm</ins></a> works.</p>\n<p>The regulatory body will now continue collecting evidence in the matter, and holds the authority within the EU to levy fines and demand changes should the platform wish to continue operations in the region.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/europe-probes-sheins-addictive-app-design-and-illegal-product-sales-125322191.html?src=rss",
