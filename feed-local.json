But in his comments to build an alternative system, insulated from great powers, he inadvertently described the Crown-Indigenous relationship, echoing the long-standing dynamics of power and exclusion that shape that relationship. In this Brief, Janna Wale and Michaela M. McGuire (Jaad Gudgihljiwah) expose this connection and ask what this means for Indigenous Peoples (who have long demanded a seat at the table – as opposed to being on the menu) to create a different kind of rupture in our own relationships, within and among Indigenous nations. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://yellowheadinstitute.org/2026/reflections-on-rupture-mark-carneys-new-world-order-an-indigenous-response/\">Reflections on “Rupture”: Mark Carney’s New World Order &#038; an Indigenous Response</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://yellowheadinstitute.org\">Yellowhead Institute</a>.</p>",
