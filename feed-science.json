The telescope's latest <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/heic2604a/\" target=\"_blank\">snapshot</a> is our clearest view yet of the Egg Nebula. Roughly 3,000 light-years away from Earth, the nebula's name is derived from its dense layer of gas and dust cloaking a central star.</p><p>The new image shows the nebula's four beams of starlight (from that central star) escaping from its gas-and-dust &quot;shell.&quot; On either side of the disc-like cloud are fast-moving outflows of hot molecular hydrogen. The orange highlights in this image indicate the glow of infrared light.</p><p>As the beams of starlight stretch out from the center, they illuminate concentric rings of gas. The gas’s ripple-like pattern suggests it was created by successive bursts from the star, with a little more ejecting every few hundred years.</p><figure><img alt=\"Hubble image of the Egg Nebula.

Balick (University of Washington)</div></figure><p>The Egg Nebula, found in the constellation Cygnus, was first discovered in 1975. Nebulae in this preplanetary phase are rare finds. Since the stage only lasts a few thousand years (and because they're often faint), they're relatively difficult for astronomers to spot. By comparing this new image with previous Hubble snapshots of the Egg Nebula, astronomers can learn more about it and shed more light on its processes. But for the rest of us, it makes for some pretty sweet eye candy, right?</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/hubble-showcases-the-egg-nebula-in-all-its-dying-star-glory-174239769.html?src=rss",

The SpaceX founder is notorious for promising optimistic timelines that never come to pass, and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-29-spacex-mars-bfr.html\"><ins>said in 2017</ins></a> that a base on Mars would be ready for its first settlers as early as 2024.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>In <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020845358151266513\"><ins>subsequent replies</ins></a> to other posts Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020836688466215254\"><ins>predicted</ins></a> &quot;Mars will start in 5 or 6 years, so will be done parallel with the Moon, but the Moon will be the initial focus.&quot; He also said a manned Mars flight might happen <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020848181433491910\"><ins>in 2031</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>Early last year Musk said in <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875023335891026324\"><ins>a post on X</ins></a> that SpaceX would be going &quot;straight to Mars&quot; and that &quot;the Moon is a distraction.&quot; This was in response to Space industry analyst <a href=\"https://planetocracy.org/\"><ins>Peter Hague</ins></a> pointing out that among other considerations, lunar regolith, a material found on the surface of the moon, is about 45 percent oxygen.
