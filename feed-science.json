This was the first medical evacuation in the history of the ISS.</p>\n<p>NASA wrote a statement saying that the astronaut experienced an unknown medical event on January 7 &quot;that required immediate attention&quot; from his fellow crew members.

The crew returned on January 15, which was a decision made by NASA's chief health and medical officer. Once the crew had landed, administrator Jared Isaacman said it was a &quot;serious situation&quot; but didn't go into any detail.</p>\n<p>Fincke has said he is currently &quot;doing very well&quot; and still participating in standard post-flight reconditioning at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. &quot;Spaceflight is an incredible privilege, and sometimes it reminds us just how human we are,&quot; he said. &quot;Thank you for all your support.&quot;</p>\n<p>We don't know what medical issue Fincke is going through, and it's certainly his business and not ours.

Today's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-examines-cranium-nebula/\" target=\"_blank\">pair</a> has brains on the brain, with a look at the fittingly named Exposed Cranium Nebula. More officially, this cloud of space dust and debris is known as Nebula PMR 1. The images shared today may capture a moment in the final stages of a star, as well as giving hints as to how the nebula got its brain-like shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The nebula appears to have distinct regions that capture different phases of its evolution — an outer shell of gas that was blown off first and consists mostly of hydrogen, and an inner cloud with more structure that contains a mix of different gases,&quot; NASA's blog post reads. The dark line that runs vertically through the nebula, giving it the cranial appearance, could be the result of &quot;an outburst or outflow from the central star, which typically occurs as twin jets burst out in opposite directions.&quot; Both Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) were used to document the nebula.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/new-webb-telescope-photos-show-off-the-exposed-cranium-nebula-235609619.html?src=rss",
