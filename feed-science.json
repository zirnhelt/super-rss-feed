On Friday, Administrator Jared Isaacman <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-adds-mission-to-artemis-lunar-program-updates-architecture/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the space agency would carry out an additional flight in 2027 to test commercial lunar landers from <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacexs-lunar-lander-could-be-years-late-for-a-planned-2027-mission-to-the-moon-180001024.html\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceX</a> and/or <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/blue-origin-is-pausing-its-space-tourist-flights-to-work-on-lunar-landers-for-nasa-143000058.html\" target=\"_blank\">Blue Origin</a>. The new mission will take the place of Artemis 3, which previously would have seen NASA attempt to land on the Moon for the first time since 1972. The flight will also see the agency test a new spacesuit made by Axiom Space.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the new plan, the redesigned Artemis 3 mission will give NASA the chance to test at least one lander in the relative safety of low Earth orbit. NASA will attempt to return humans to the Moon during Artemis 4 sometime in 2028, with the potential for another mission as early as later that same year. Per <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nasa-artemis-moon-program-overhaul/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CBS News</em></a>, the decision comes after NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Plan said the agency's existing mission plan was too risky.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;NASA must standardize its approach, increase flight rate safely, and execute on the President’s national space policy. With credible competition from our greatest geopolitical adversary increasing by the day, we need to move faster, eliminate delays, and achieve our objectives,&quot; said Isaacman. &quot;Standardizing vehicle configuration, increasing flight rate and progressing through objectives in a logical, phased approach, is how we achieved the near-impossible in 1969 and it is how we will do it again.&quot;</p><p>The change of plan also comes as Artemis 2 has faced multiple delays in recent months. The Space Launch System (SLS) heavy-lift rocket has, once again, proven to be temperamental. NASA had planned to launch Artemis 2 in early February, but pushed the flight back after it <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-moves-artemis-2-launch-to-march-after-hydrogen-leak-during-testing-140000351.html\" target=\"_blank\">caught a hydrogen leak during a fueling test</a>. More recently, NASA delayed the mission to give its engineers time to fix a helium pressurization issue in the upper stage of the SLS.&nbsp; At the earliest, the mission can now get underway on April 1. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/nasa-overhauls-artemis-program-delaying-moon-landing-to-2028-164255318.html?src=rss",

The space agency just revealed that the <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/commercialcrew/2026/02/25/nasas-spacex-crew-11-astronaut-update/\"><ins>impacted astronaut was Mike Fincke</ins></a>. This was the first medical evacuation in the history of the ISS.</p>\n<p>NASA wrote a statement saying that the astronaut experienced an unknown medical event on January 7 &quot;that required immediate attention&quot; from his fellow crew members. Fincke added that his &quot;status quickly stabilized&quot; thanks to the &quot;quick response and the guidance&quot; of the flight surgeons.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>However, the incident did force NASA to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-delays-spacewalk-due-to-a-medical-concern-with-a-crew-member-171900024.html\"><ins>cancel a spacewalk</ins></a> planned for January 8. Soon after that, the agency announced it would be ending the Crew-11 mission a month early. The four-person crew included Fincke, NASA astronaut Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.</p>\n<div id=\"9a3341f4331b4ac3ac496acd2470f5eb\"></div>\n<p>They had been living and working aboard the ISS since August and were expected to stay until February. The crew returned on January 15, which was a decision made by NASA's chief health and medical officer. Once the crew had landed, administrator Jared Isaacman said it was a &quot;serious situation&quot; but didn't go into any detail.</p>\n<p>Fincke has said he is currently &quot;doing very well&quot; and still participating in standard post-flight reconditioning at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. &quot;Spaceflight is an incredible privilege, and sometimes it reminds us just how human we are,&quot; he said. &quot;Thank you for all your support.&quot;</p>\n<p>We don't know what medical issue Fincke is going through, and it's certainly his business and not ours. In any event, we wish for a speedy recovery.</p>\n<div id=\"1187a23f173446e8a18c51ab99ea671d\"></div>\n<p>NASA also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-is-sending-crew-12-astronauts-to-the-iss-on-february-11-153000139.html\"><ins>moved up the launch of Crew-12</ins></a> to replace the prematurely-returned astronauts.

After an 18-month effort to clear out 3,000 tonnes of rubbish and restore the stone walls and adjacent area, the 17th-century Bansilalpet stepwell had become a source of clean drinking water for the first time in four decades.</p><p>“It was such a joyous moment to see water collecting into the stepwell after clearing 40 years of garbage,” says Hajira Adeeb, a 45-year-old resident of Bansilalpet, who grew up seeing the well become transformed from the community’s water source to a dumping ground. “I visit almost every day. The area is clean and lit up in the evenings. I enjoy sitting there.”</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/feb/26/ancient-stepwells-brought-back-india-run-out-water-day-zero\">Continue reading...</a>",

Today's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/missions/webb/nasas-webb-examines-cranium-nebula/\" target=\"_blank\">pair</a> has brains on the brain, with a look at the fittingly named Exposed Cranium Nebula. More officially, this cloud of space dust and debris is known as Nebula PMR 1. The images shared today may capture a moment in the final stages of a star, as well as giving hints as to how the nebula got its brain-like shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The nebula appears to have distinct regions that capture different phases of its evolution — an outer shell of gas that was blown off first and consists mostly of hydrogen, and an inner cloud with more structure that contains a mix of different gases,&quot; NASA's blog post reads. The dark line that runs vertically through the nebula, giving it the cranial appearance, could be the result of &quot;an outburst or outflow from the central star, which typically occurs as twin jets burst out in opposite directions.&quot; Both Webb's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) were used to document the nebula.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/new-webb-telescope-photos-show-off-the-exposed-cranium-nebula-235609619.html?src=rss",
