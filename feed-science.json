      "content_html": "<p>Researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope have found a galaxy that is offering new data about the early stages of the universe's existence. The latest <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://esawebb.org/news/weic2603/?lang\" target=\"_blank\">discovery</a> shared by astronomers is about a bright galaxy dubbed MoM-z14. According to the team, this galaxy existed 280 million years after the Big Bang.&nbsp;</p><p>The sounds like a long time, but in the context of the universe's estimated 13.8 billion years of existence, that's actually one of the closest examples astronomers have found to the Big Bang's occurrence. As a result, MoM-z14 can offer some insights and some surprises about what the early stages of the universe entailed.</p><p>&quot;With Webb, we are able to see farther than humans ever have before, and it looks nothing like what we predicted, which is both challenging and exciting,&quot; lead author Rohan Naidu of Massachusetts Institute of Technology said. The findings about this galaxy were published in the <em>Open Journal of Astrophysics</em>.</p><p>The scientists were able to date MoM-z14 with Webb's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://esawebb.org/about/instruments/nirspec/\" target=\"_blank\">Near-Infrared Spectrograph</a> instrument, analyzing how light from the galaxy changed wavelengths as it traveled to reach the telescope. One of the initial questions sparked by this bright galaxy centers on the presence of nitrogen. Some early galaxies, including MoM-z14, have revealed higher nitrogen concentrations than scientists had projected was possible. Another topic of interest is about reionization, or the process of stars producing enough light or energy to permeate the dense hydrogen fog that existed in the early universe.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s an incredibly exciting time, with Webb revealing the early Universe like never before and showing us how much there still is to discover” said Pennsylvania State University graduate student and team member Yijia Li.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/astronomers-share-new-insights-about-the-early-universe-via-the-webb-space-telescope-213311848.html?src=rss",
