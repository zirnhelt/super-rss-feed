New research shows that people with obesity host a distinct oral microbiome compared to individuals at a healthy weight. Rather than zeroing in on the gut microbiome, the study turns our attention to the mouth as a potential biological signal of metabolic health. It’s a shift that could challenge long-held assumptions about where obesity-related biomarkers can be measured.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/disease/obesity/oral-bacteria-metabolic-health-obesity/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/disease/obesity/\">Obesity</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/disease/\">Illnesses and conditions</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/medical/\">Body and Mind</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/obesity/\" rel=\"tag\">Obesity</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/metabolism/\" rel=\"tag\">metabolism</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/oral-bacteria/\" rel=\"tag\">Oral bacteria</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/insulin/\" rel=\"tag\">Insulin</a></p>",

They will study how  pneumonia-causing bacteria can lead to long-term heart damage, for instance, and will also look into how a person’s physical characteristics can affect blood flow during spaceflight. NASA’s live coverage for the docking starts at 1:15 PM. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/watch-the-nasa-spacex-crew-12-mission-dock-with-the-iss-180000450.html?src=rss",
