Since the lion is at the top of the food chain, it doesn’t particularly require privacy. But for animals like deer, making loud sounds isn’t exactly the safest way to communicate. So, to get noticed, deer mark areas with rubs and scrapes, known as signposts. Now, a new study in Ecology and Evolution reports that these signposts hold a hidden glow, and other deer can see it.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/biology/forests-glow-uv-light-deer-communication/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/biology/\">Biology</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/science/\">Science</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/bioluminescence/\" rel=\"tag\">Bioluminescence</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/deer/\" rel=\"tag\">Deer</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/forest/\" rel=\"tag\">Forest</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/communications/\" rel=\"tag\">Communications</a></p>",

These bacteria are particularly good at evading the effects of antibiotics, making them a major cause of hard-to-treat infections, often transmitted during hospital stays. The acronym that classifies them consists of the first letters of the six bacteria that belong to the group: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/biology/drug-resistant-bacteria-sugar/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/biology/\">Biology</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/science/\">Science</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/antibiotic-resistant-bacteria/\" rel=\"tag\">Antibiotic-resistant bacteria</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/bacteria/\" rel=\"tag\">Bacteria</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/infections/\" rel=\"tag\">Infections</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/immunotherapy/\" rel=\"tag\">Immunotherapy</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/university-of-melbourne/\" rel=\"tag\">University of Melbourne</a></p>",

The telescope's latest <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://esahubble.org/images/heic2604a/\" target=\"_blank\">snapshot</a> is our clearest view yet of the Egg Nebula. Roughly 3,000 light-years away from Earth, the nebula's name is derived from its dense layer of gas and dust cloaking a central star.</p><p>The new image shows the nebula's four beams of starlight (from that central star) escaping from its gas-and-dust &quot;shell.&quot; On either side of the disc-like cloud are fast-moving outflows of hot molecular hydrogen. The orange highlights in this image indicate the glow of infrared light.</p><p>As the beams of starlight stretch out from the center, they illuminate concentric rings of gas. The gas’s ripple-like pattern suggests it was created by successive bursts from the star, with a little more ejecting every few hundred years.</p><figure><img alt=\"Hubble image of the Egg Nebula.

Balick (University of Washington)</div></figure><p>The Egg Nebula, found in the constellation Cygnus, was first discovered in 1975. Nebulae in this preplanetary phase are rare finds. Since the stage only lasts a few thousand years (and because they're often faint), they're relatively difficult for astronomers to spot. By comparing this new image with previous Hubble snapshots of the Egg Nebula, astronomers can learn more about it and shed more light on its processes. But for the rest of us, it makes for some pretty sweet eye candy, right?</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/hubble-showcases-the-egg-nebula-in-all-its-dying-star-glory-174239769.html?src=rss",
