The Steam Deck has gone in and out of stock in the past, but <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://kotaku.com/its-becoming-impossible-to-buy-a-steam-deck-sold-out-valve-prices-ram-shortage-2000667790\" target=\"_blank\">as <em>Kotaku</em> notes</a>, the timing does raise the question whether Valve's RAM issues could also be impacting its Linux handheld. </p><p>The 256GB Steam Deck LCD, and both the 512GB and 1TB models of the Steam Deck OLED, are completely sold out on Steam. Valve announced that it was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/valve-discontinued-the-last-remaining-lcd-model-of-the-steam-deck-171548195.html\" target=\"_blank\">discontinuing the LCD versions of its handheld</a> and selling through its remaining inventory in December 2025, so the fact that the 256GB Steam Deck model is currently sold out isn't surprising. That both OLED versions are also unavailable at the same time, though, is a bit more unusual.</p><p>Engadget has contacted Valve for more information about the availability of the Steam Deck. We'll update this article if we hear back.</p><p>When Valve announced the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Machine, Steam Controller</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Frame</a>, the company notably left pricing and availability off the table, presumably because tariffs and access to RAM were leaving those details in flux. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english\" target=\"_blank\">The company's announcement</a> last week that the memory and storage shortage had pushed back its plans and would likely impact prices more or less confirmed that. At no point did Valve mention that the Steam Deck would be similarly affected, but maybe it should have.</p><p>The rising cost of RAM has already forced other PC makers to adjust the pricing of their computers. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/framework-increases-desktop-prices-by-up-to-460-due-to-ram-crisis-234827145.html\" target=\"_blank\">Framework announced</a> in January that it was raising the price of its Framework Desktop by as much as $460. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html\" target=\"_blank\">Some analysts</a> assume that the memory shortage driven by the AI industry could lead to higher prices and even an economic downturn in the wider PC industry. Ideally, the Steam Deck being out of stock is a temporary issue rather than a sign that Valve is doing something drastic. If things continue as they are, however, changes to the Steam Deck likely won't be off the table.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-great-ramaggedon-of-2026-might-have-just-claimed-the-steam-deck-211958306.html?src=rss",

At some point, this turned into a meme, with users writing posts jokingly addressed to the algorithm in which they requested to see more posts about the topics they're actually interested in.</p><p>Now, Meta is turning those &quot;Dear algorithm&quot; posts into an official feature that it says will allow Threads users to tune their recommendations in real time. With the change, users can write a post that begins with &quot;dear algo&quot; to adjust their preferences. For example, you could write &quot;dear algo, show me more posts about cute cats.&quot; You can also ask to see fewer posts about topics you don't want to see, like &quot;dear algo, stop showing me posts about sick pets.&quot;</p><p>You can track your requests to the algorithm in the app's settings in order to revisit them or remove them. You can also retweet other users' &quot;dear algo&quot; posts to have those topics reflected in your feed. Importantly, &quot;dear algo&quot; requests are temporary and only last for three days at a time, which Meta says is meant to keep the algorithm feel fresher and more flexible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The rollout of the feature follows a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/your-dear-algo-threads-posts-might-actually-do-something-soon-215448062.html\" target=\"_blank\">limited test</a> late last year.

Any satellites launched from the Moon would presumably orbit the Moon as well, though Musk didn't provide any additional details.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;You have to go to the moon&quot; in order to build the required AI capabilities, Musk told employees. &quot;It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about, but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Such a catapult would certainly need to be powerful — though the Moon has only one-sixth the gravity of Earth, the minimum escape velocity required for orbit is still around 3,800 MPH or five times the speed of sound. That's currently possible with electromagnetic <a href=\"https://taskandpurpose.com/news/navy-railgun-battleships/\">railguns</a> that launch projectiles at speeds up to Mach 8.8, though any satellite launched by such a device would need to withstand acceleration forces around 10,000 g or more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It's fun to think about it, but there are a few <em>tiny</em> steps required first. That starts with orbiting the Moon and eventually landing on the surface. Then you'd need to build a colony, followed by a factory, all of which would require a large number of manned and unmanned expeditions. As a reminder, we haven't been to the moon for over 50 years and none of the colony or factory stuff has ever been done.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Early last year Musk said in <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875023335891026324\">a post on X</a> that SpaceX would be going &quot;straight to Mars&quot; and that &quot;the Moon is a distraction.&quot; However, the CEO apparently shifted his near-term priorities to building a &quot;self-growing city on the Moon&quot; because it's a more achievable target. In a <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2020640004628742577\">post on X</a>, Musk said the company could complete this in less than 10 years, while doing the same on Mars would take over 20 years.</p>\n<p>Any estimates from Musk himself certainly need to be treated skeptically, though. Elon once <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-29-space-x-mars-bfr-elon-musk.html\">said in 2017</a> that SpaceX would send cargo missions to Mars by 2022 aboard a rocket that's still being tested in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/elon-musks-latest-scheme-is-a-satellite-catapult-on-the-moon-113403143.html?src=rss",

Secure Boot was a way for Microsoft to protect systems from running unsigned and potentially malicious code before Windows launched. It went on to be an <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040-200028741.html\" target=\"_blank\">installation requirement for Windows 11</a>, as well as anti-cheat software used in <em>Valorant, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6/7</em> and <em>Battlefield 6</em>.  </p><p>Without the new Secure Boot certificates, Microsoft says your system will still function normally, but it will enter &quot;a degraded security state that limits its ability to receive future boot-level protections.&quot; Basically, you won't be protected from malware and viruses targeting vulnerabilities in older versions of Windows. As expected, Microsoft also notes that unsupported versions of Windows won't be receiving the new Secure Boot certificates. They're only coming to Windows 11 systems, as well as <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-what-are-my-options-when-windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-160534495.html\" target=\"_blank\">Windows 10 PCs subscribed to Microsoft's Extended Security Updates</a>.</p><p>Microsoft says many users will be able to pick up the updated Secure Boot certificates by visiting Windows Update, but a few may need additional firmware updates from their system (or motherboard’s) OEM. You’ll also be able to track the status of your security certificates in the Windows Security app in the “coming months.”</p><p>&quot;As cryptographic security evolves, certificates and keys must be periodically refreshed to maintain strong protection,&quot; Nuno Costa, Partner Director of Windows Servicing and Delivery, wrote in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=180181\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post today</a>. &quot;Retiring old certificates and introducing new ones is a standard industry practice that helps prevent aging credentials from becoming a weak point and keeps platforms aligned with modern security expectations.&quot;</p><p>Costa says Microsoft has been working with OEMs like Dell and HP to ensure a smooth transition to the new Secure Boot certificates. Many new systems built in 2024 already have the updated certs, while &quot;almost all&quot; devices shipped last year have them as well.

A <a href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/remove-explicit-images/\">new tool from Google</a> won't do much in the way of prevention, but can help you remove this media from Search.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now, you can choose an image and quickly request its deletion. Just click on the three dots that appear on the image. From there, choose &quot;remove result&quot; and then &quot;It shows a sexual image of me.&quot; Other choices include the picture shows a person under 18 and that it has your personal information. If you choose the initial option then you will also be asked whether it contains a real image or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-is-investigating-grok-over-ai-generated-csam-and-nonconsensual-deepfakes-202029635.html\">deepfake</a>. There's also an option to submit multiple photos at once.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Google claims that, upon submitting your request, you will &quot;immediately&quot; see links to emotional and legal support organizations. Plus, you can opt-in to safeguards that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-makes-it-easier-to-remove-explicit-deepfakes-from-its-search-results-130058499.html\">filter out similar results</a> in Search — though it seems these unreported images will still be available for other users to see. This feature should be available in most countries over the coming days.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can go on Google's <a href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/results-about-you-government-id-numbers/\">&quot;Results about you&quot; hub</a> to track your request. To use the tool, you will have to add in your personal contact information and government ID numbers. Google already had the hub to track if any of that information appears on Search, but now it will also look for your social security number, drivers license and passport information. The company should notify you if any of that information comes up in Search results and allow you to take removal steps.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Results about you's updates should roll out to US users in the coming days. Notably, it arrives as Google shutters its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/google-is-retiring-its-free-dark-web-monitoring-tool-next-year-023103252.html\">dark web reports</a>. They would alert you if your name, number, or email address appeared on the internet — typically because of a data breach. However, Google found it didn't help users take next steps to fix the problem, something these new features will hopefully do.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/googles-new-tool-helps-you-remove-non-consensual-explicit-images-from-search-155352248.html?src=rss",

But even so, I am still wondering why the Zenbook Duo hasn't had a bigger impact on the market after ASUS released its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-duo-review-specs-price-the-first-dual-screen-laptop-worth-buying-130016756.html\" target=\"_blank\">first true dual-screen laptop two years ago</a>. Notebooks like these provide the kind of screen space you'd typically only get from a dual monitor setup, but in a much more compact form factor that you can easily take on the road. It could be that people were wary of an unfamiliar design, shorter battery life or buying a first-gen product — all of which are understandable concerns. However, now that ASUS has given the ZenBook Duo a total redesign for 2026, the company has addressed practically all of those barriers to entry while making it an even more convincing machine for anyone who could use more display space. Which, in my experience, is pretty much everyone.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Editor’s note:</em></strong><em> The 2026 ASUS Zenbook Duo is expected to be available for pre-order sometime in late February, with general availability slated for March. </em></p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h2>\n<p>For the new model, ASUS didn't mess with the laptop's basic layout too much. Instead, the company polished and tightened everything up, resulting in a system that weighs about the same (3.6 pounds) while reducing its overall size (12.1 x 8.2 x 0.77 to 0.92 inches) by five percent. Critically, you still get a built-in kickstand on the bottom and a detachable keyboard that you move wherever you want. There’s also a decent number of ports, including two USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, one USB-A 3.2 jack, HDMI 2.1 and a combo audio port. That said, I do wish ASUS had found room for an SD card reader of some kind, though given the Zenbook Duo's unique design, I get why that didn't make it.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"The Zenbook Duo's detachable keyboard gives users a ton of flexibility when it comes to utilizing both of the laptop's displays. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zenbook-duo-long-mode.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  The Zenbook Duo's detachable keyboard gives users a ton of flexibility when it comes to utilizing both of the laptop's displays. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>One of the Zenbook Duo's most important design upgrades is a new &quot;hideaway&quot; hinge that reduces the gap between the laptop's two screens. Not only does this make the laptop easier and more pleasant to use in dual-screen mode, it also allows the entire system to lay flat on a table, which is nice for drawing or sharing your screen with someone sitting opposite you. Unfortunately, while my review unit didn’t come with one, ASUS says its forthcoming Pen 3.0 will come bundled with the Zenbook Duo in the US, so you won’t need to pay extra for it. </p>\n<p>Another small but appreciated improvement is the new pogo pins below the lower display, which provides a more secure and reliable way of keeping the laptop's detachable keyboard topped up. In my experience, even after running multiple rundown tests that completely drained the Duo's battery, I never had to charge up the keyboard on its own. It was always smart enough to sip electricity from the main system in the background, though it also has a built-in USB-C port for power just in case. On the flipside, if you're not scared of typing on glass, you can still use the lower screen as a keyboard and touchpad, or as a place to display widgets for news, the weather, performance and more.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-displays\">Displays</h2>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"As someone who loves a desktop with dual monitors, I can't overstate how nice it is to have similar built-in functionality on a laptop. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zenbook-duo-stacked_7404.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  As someone who loves a desktop with dual monitors, I can't overstate how nice it is to have similar built-in functionality on a laptop. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>The standout feature on the Zenbook Duo continues to be its dual displays, and now for 2026, they look better than ever. Both OLED panels have a 144Hz refresh rate with a 2,880 x 1,800 resolution while also covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum. And while its nominal brightness of 500 nits for SDR content is just OK, ASUS makes up for that with peaks of up to 1,000 nits in HDR. And to make both screens even more enjoyable, ASUS managed to shrink the size of their bezels down to just 8.28mm. That's a reduction of 70 percent compared to the previous model, so now there's even less getting in the way of you utilizing these screens to their fullest.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-performance\">Performance</h2>\n<p>The Zenbook Duo can be configured with a range of new Intel Core Ultra 7 and Core Ultra 9 processors, including the X9 388H chip used on our review unit. For general use and productivity, the laptop is super smooth and responsive, though that shouldn't be a surprise coming from Intel's latest top-of-the-line mobile CPU. However, for those seeking max performance, some of the benchmark numbers aren't quite as impressive as you might expect. That’s because ASUS has limited the Duo's TDP (thermal design power) to 45 watts — which is shy of the chip's 80-watt turbo power limit.</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"The kickstand in back adds a bit a bulk, but it's better than not having one at all like with Lenovo's Yoga Book. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zenbook-duop-kickstand.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  The kickstand in back adds a bit a bulk, but it's better than not having one at all like with Lenovo's Yoga Book. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>In PCMark 10, the Zenbook Duo only managed a score of 7,153 compared to 9,651 from a Dell XPS 14, despite the latter having a lower-tier Intel Core Ultra X7 358H processor. That said, in other tests like Geekbench 6, the Duo had no trouble staying on top with a multicore score of 17,095 versus 9,651 for the Dell.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another pleasant surprise is that because the Duo's chip comes with Intel's upgraded Arc B390 integrated GPU, this thing has plenty of oomph to game on, let alone edit videos or other similar tasks. In <em>Elden Ring </em>at 1,920 x 1,200, the Zenbook maintained a relatively stable framerate between 55 and 60 fps on high settings, which is great considering this thing doesn't have discrete graphics. This means as long as you don't mind fiddling with game options a bit, you should be able to play newer AAA games without too much trouble.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-battery-life\">Battery life</h2>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"The left side of the Zenbook Duo features a full-size HDMI connector along with a USB-C port, plus a backup USB-C jack for charging the detachable keyboard. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/zenbook-duo-left-side_0806.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  The left side of the Zenbook Duo features a full-size HDMI connector along with a USB-C port, plus a backup USB-C jack for charging the detachable keyboard. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>You'd think a laptop with two displays would be super power hungry. However, by increasing the capacity of its cell from 75WHrs to 99WHrs, ASUS has made the Zenbook Duo's endurance (or lack thereof) a complete non-issue. On PCMark 10's Modern Office rundown test, the laptop lasted 18 hours and 33 minutes in single-screen mode. Granted, that's nearly four hours less than what we got from <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-prestige-14-flip-ai-review-an-ultraportable-for-arc-raiders-thanks-to-intels-panther-lake-160000606.html\" target=\"_blank\">MSI's Prestige 14 Flip AI+</a>, but considering that's the longest-lasting notebook we've ever tested, I'm not bothered. When compared to<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-zenbook-a14-review-a-lightweight-in-every-sense-133013668.html\" target=\"_blank\"> ASUS' own Zenbook A14</a> (18:16), things are basically a wash, which I think is a win for the Duo, as the A14 is meant to be an ultralight system with an emphasis on portability and longevity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Obviously, battery life takes a hit when you're using both displays. However, when I re-ran our battery test with its two displays turned on, the Duo still impressed with a time of 14:23. This is more than enough to give you the confidence to set this thing up in dual-screen mode even when an outlet isn't close at hand. Thankfully, for times when you do need a power adapter, the charging brick on ASUS' cable is rather compact, so it's not a chore to lug it around.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"The Zenbook Duo's battery life is good enough you won't always need its power brick.

However, even if you're not willing to make that jump just yet, the Zenbook Duo still has all of its bases covered. Its detachable keyboard gives you a pleasant experience while freeing up the bottom of the notebook to be a second display. This allows you to have something similar to a traditional dual-monitor desktop but in a chassis that you can easily take on the road without any major compromises.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The 2026 Zenbook Duo combines a compact design with strong performance, plenty of ports and surprisingly good battery life. Sure, it's a touch heavier than a typical 14-inch laptop, but its two screens more than make up for a little added weight and thickness. That leaves price as the Duo's remaining drawback, and starting at $2,100 (or $2,300 as reviewed), it certainly isn't cheap.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, when you consider that a similarly equipped rival like a <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=b1bb23c9-a2d4-4e4e-bfac-7a560ebe7641&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c537d36d-6a93-4550-8009-0302f4c847ec&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Dell+Technologies&amp;linkText=Dell+XPS+14&amp;custData=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_X2dsPTEqMWRxemI0ZypfdXAqTVEuLipfZ3MqTVEuLiZnY2xpZD1DajBLQ1FpQW5KSE1CaERBQVJJc0FCcjdiODZ0TDc1MGd3TGI4ZnNzd0xkWlBtNkktSDhQX0pwTDEzdGdTb0NWMkVhU2hZSU9pNHZKZEdrYUFsWmNFQUx3X3djQiZnY2xzcmM9YXcuZHMmZ2JyYWlkPTBBQUFBQURsbFhRZERBTHJvTzRkTGxINnpPOU5FZV9pMDAjY3VzdG9taXphdGlvbi1hbmNob3IifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQf9UJYs7wrmpxbtgho4ZRvsmoEzsFiX5CB9-j0UehVy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-laptops%2Fdell-xps-14-laptop%2Fspd%2Fxps-da14260-laptop%2Fuseda14260wcto03%3F_gl%3D1*1dqzb4g*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAnJHMBhDAARIsABr7b86tL750gwLb8fsswLdZPm6I-H8P_JpL13tgSoCV2EaShYIOi4vJdGkaAlZcEALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds%26gbraid%3D0AAAAADllXQdDALroO4dLlH6zO9NEe_i00%23customization-anchor\" target=\"_blank\">Dell XPS 14</a> costs just $50 less for a single screen, that price difference is rather negligible. Alternatively, if you opt for a more affordable ultraportable and then tack on a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-portable-monitor-120050851.html\" target=\"_blank\">decent third-party portable monitor</a>, you're still likely looking at a package that costs between $1,500 and $1,800. Plus, that setup is significantly bulkier and more annoying to carry around. So while the Zenbook Duo might be an unconventional pick right now, it has all the tools to deliver unmatched portable productivity and I don’t think it will be too much longer until the masses catch on.</p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-zenbook-duo-2026-review-two-screens-really-are-better-than-one-140000982.html?src=rss",

It’s the first of many, if the companies stick to their plan, which is to produce more than 1,000 bZ4X robotaxis this year. The bZ4X is one of the three autonomous vehicle models Pony.ai intends to use for commercial services in Tier 1 Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai. The other two vehicles are already being used for Pony.ai’s  ride-hailing service, while the bZ4X robotaxis will be gradually integrated into its fleet. Pony.ai’s goal is to operate 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026. </p><p>Toyota introduced the new bZ4X last year, and the non-autonomous versions are available for purchase to the public. Pony.ai’s version comes equipped with the company’s Gen-7 autonomous driving system, which features Bluetooth-based automatic vehicle unlocking and in-cabin voice interaction. It also comes integrated with online music services and braking patterns that can help minimize motion sickness for passengers. Pony.ai was founded in 2016 and has been testing and operating self-driving vehicles since then. It <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beijing-approves-driverless-taxi-permits-for-baidu-and-ponyai-232843455.html\" target=\"_blank\">received permission</a> from Beijing to offer self-driving car services to the general public back in 2022. While It’s a Chinese company, it has headquarters in Silicon Valley and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-robotaxi-firm-pony-ai-files-us-ipo-2024-10-17/\" target=\"_blank\">filed for an IPO</a> in the US in 2024.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/toyota-and-ponyai-start-mass-producing-robotaxis-for-china-130833065.html?src=rss",

The company the city and making sure they can operate as fully autonomous rides before launching a paid service in the location. Waymo <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/waymo-is-headed-to-nashville-in-2026-140807997.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that it was planning to bring its robotaxis to Nashville in September 2025, with the intention opening up rides to the public sometime this year. The company has been testing its technology in Nashville since then, but it has yet say when it’ll start accepting bookings for rides.</p><p>The company conducts extensive testing in every new city before deploying its robotaxi service. It starts by having safety drivers map the area and then updating its software with information learned from those tests, since each city has its own driving rules and conditions. Despite its testing, Waymo has had to issue a software recall several times in the past  after its vehicles malfunctioned when faced with real hazards on the road. Its vehicles were previously seeing hitting gates, chains, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/waymo-issues-recall-after-one-its-self-driving-taxis-crashed-into-a-pole-121937607.html\" target=\"_blank\">telephone poles</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/waymo-issued-a-recall-after-two-robotaxis-crashed-into-the-same-pickup-truck-055708611.html\" target=\"_blank\">stationary vehicles</a>.

That is why we are considering quickly imposing interim measures on Meta, to preserve access for competitors to WhatsApp while the investigation is ongoing, and avoid Meta’s new policy irreparably harming competition in Europe.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The issue arose in October when Meta announced updates to its WhatsApp Business Solution Terms. According to the European Commission, the January 15 update would &quot;effectively&quot; make <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-ai-is-coming-to-europe-this-week-113019014.html\">Meta AI</a> the only AI assistant available on WhatsApp. The regulatory agency <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2896\">opened an investigation</a> into the matter on December 4.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today's update stands as a warning to Meta that the European Commission initially believes the company has violated antitrust regulation. A final decision is still to come. It also gave Meta a chance to respond to the allegations — which it swiftly did.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;The facts are ‍that there is no reason for the EU to ​intervene in the WhatsApp ‌Business API,&quot; a Meta spokesperson <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/meta-criticises-eu-antitrust-move-against-whatsapp-block-ai-rivals-2026-02-09/\">told <em>Reuters</em></a>. &quot;There are many AI options and people can use them from app stores, operating ⁠systems, devices, websites, ​and industry ​partnerships.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-warns-meta-over-blocking-rival-ai-chatbots-on-whatsapp-121708895.html?src=rss",
