In Premiere, the company’s video-editing software, it has unveiled a new AI-powered Object Mask feature that lets you easily pick and track persons or objects moving through your video clips. You simply have to hover over that object and click to generate a mask overlay in seconds. While the mask is supposed to be accurate from the start, you can adjust and resize it as needed. Adobe says the feature uses its own AI model for the feature and that the processing happens on-device. It also says that it doesn’t use your activities and data to train its models.</p><p>The company has also given its Shape Mask tool an upgrade. You can generate its redesigned Ellipse, Rectangle and Pen masks directly from the toolbar. Further, it updated their controls to make moving or adjusting the masks more precise. The masks can now also track objects on your video clips 20 times faster than their predecessors, which means you won’t have to keep such a close eye on the status bar. Another new Premiere update lets you easily bring media from from Firefly Boards, Adobe’s AI-powered digital canvas, into the program. In addition,  Adobe Stock is now fully integrated within Premiere. </p><p>For After Effects, Adobe has rolled out an update that lets you import  SVG files that are commonly used in Illustrator. You can now also build graphics and photorealistic objects inside images with 3D parametric meshes, consisting of cubes, spheres, cylinders, cones, toris and planes, within the visual effects software. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/adobe-unveils-new-ai-powered-video-editing-tools-for-premiere-140000970.html?src=rss</p>",
