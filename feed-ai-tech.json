      "content_html": "<p>Anthropic has been building out support for third-party apps inside of Claude. As of today, the chatbot can now connect to platforms like Slack and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-ai-now-integrates-with-canva-201808571.html\" target=\"_blank\">Canva</a>, fetching up files from inside those apps or performing tasks within them on a user's behalf.</p><p>For instance, when connected to Box, Claude can now search for files, preview documents inline and answer questions about the content in front of you. Meanwhile, with a connection to Asana, it can now turn chats into projects, tasks and timelines your co-workers can then find and interact with on the project management app.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Box and Asana are just two of the platforms adding deeper integrations with Claude today. In total, there are nine launch partners, with some of the more notable ones including Canva, Figma and Slack.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As with Anthropic's past integrations, the new functionality is powered by Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. MCP is a technology Anthropic released in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\" target=\"_blank\">fall 2024</a> to make it easier for third-party platforms to connect their systems to Claude. Since then, the protocol has become an industry standard. OpenAI, for instance, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://community.openai.com/t/introducing-support-for-remote-mcp-servers-image-generation-code-interpreter-and-more-in-the-responses-api/1266973\" target=\"_blank\">adopted MCP last year</a>, and has been building additional support since then. At the end of last year, Anthropic donated the protocol to the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation\" target=\"_blank\">Linux Foundation</a>. The company says AI platforms will be able to bring similar integrations to their own products since they're built on a new open extension designed by Anthropic. &nbsp; </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-now-offers-deeper-integrations-with-apps-like-canva-and-slack-180000604.html?src=rss",

      "content_html": "<p>OpenAI is releasing a new app called Prism today, and it hopes it does for science what coding agents like Claude Code and its own Codex platform have done for programming.&nbsp;</p><p>Prism builds on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://crixet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crixet</a>, a cloud-based LaTeX platform the company is announcing it acquired today. For the uninitiated, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.latex-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">LaTeX</a> is a typesetting system for formatting scientific documents and journals. Nearly the entire scientific community relies on LaTeX, but it can make some tasks, such as drawing diagrams through TikZ commands, time-consuming to do. Beyond that, LaTeX is just one of the software tools a scientist might turn to when preparing to publish their research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That's where Prism comes into the picture. Like Crixet before it, the app offers robust LaTeX editing and a built-in AI assistant. Where previously it was Crixet's own Chirp agent, now it's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-52-to-take-on-google-and-anthropic-185029007.html\" target=\"_blank\">GPT-5.2 Thinking</a>. OpenAI's model can help with more than just formatting journals — in a press demo, an OpenAI employee used it to find and incorporate scientific literature that was relevant to the paper they were working on, with GPT-5.2 automating the process of writing the bibliography.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;None of this absolves the scientist of the responsibility to verify that their references are correct, but it can certainly speed up the process,&quot; said Kevin Weil, vice president of science for OpenAI, when asked during the demo the possibility of ChatGPT generating fake citations.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We're conscious that, as AI becomes more capable, there are concerns around volume, quality and trust in the scientific community,&quot; he later added. &quot;Our view is that the right response is not to keep AI at arm's length or let it operate invisibly in the background; it's to integrate it directly into scientific workflows in ways that preserve accountability and keep researchers in control.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Later in the same demo, the OpenAI employee used Prism to generate a lesson plan for a graduate course on general relativity, as well as a set of problems for students to solve. OpenAI envisions these features helping scientists and professors spend less time on the more tedious tasks in their professions.&nbsp;</p><p>Prism is available to anyone with a personal ChatGPT account. It includes support for unlimited projects and collaborators. OpenAI plans to bring the software to organizations on ChatGPT Business, Team, Enterprise and Education plans soon.&nbsp;Crixet won’t be offered separately. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-releases-prism-a-claude-code-like-app-for-scientific-research-180000454.html?src=rss",

      "content_html": "<p>The Trump administration is planning on using Google Gemini to draft important federal regulations, <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-artificial-intelligence-google-gemini-transportation-regulations\"><ins>as reported by </ins><em><ins>ProPublica</ins></em></a>. This is starting with the Department of Transportation, according to interviews with agency staffers. Regulations created by the DOT help keep us safe when traveling.</p>\n<p>The plan was initially presented to DOT staffers last month, with agency attorney Daniel Cohen writing to colleagues about AI's &quot;potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings.&quot; Gregory Zerzan, the agency's general counsel, has indicated that President Donald Trump is &quot;very excited by this initiative&quot; and that DOT will be &quot;the first agency that is fully enabled to use AI to draft rules.&quot; This does suggest a pilot program of sorts, with eventual plans to bring AI to other departments.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"c7604dd648514ab68e0ce54091b1ded9\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">NEW: The Trump administration is planning to use AI to write federal regulations despite the risk of hallucinations.<br /><br />“We don't even need a very good rule,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USDOT?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@USDOT</a>’s top lawyer said of the plan, per meeting notes reviewed by ProPublica. “We want good enough.” 🧵 <a href=\"https://t.co/YKGvmlkMCt\">pic.twitter.com/YKGvmlkMCt</a></p>— Jesse Coburn (@Jesse_Coburn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jesse_Coburn/status/2015764243728003411?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 26, 2026</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>Oddly, Zerzan doesn't seem that interested in high-quality regulations. <em>ProPublica</em> received transcripts of a meeting in which he declared that &quot;we don't need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don't even need a very good rule on XYZ.&quot; He went on to say that &quot;we want good enough&quot; and that &quot;we're flooding the zone.&quot;</p>\n<p>Let me remind you that DOT regulates the safety standards of commercial aircraft, along with rules involving the transport of hazardous materials and driver qualifications. The agency's rules touch on every aspect of transportation safety. Why would the federal government rely on a new technology that's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/techs-biggest-losers-of-2025-140000419.html\"><ins>notorious for making mistakes</ins></a>?</p>\n<div id=\"cc820b6000094d528455767cda0daac8\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">AI “hallucinations” eg false/made-up info now becoming a problem in scientific publications.

Writing and revising complex federal regulations can take months, but Google Gemini can spit something out in minutes. A DOT employee giving a presentation on the program suggested that many parts of these regulations are just &quot;word salad&quot; anyways, so AI should be able to do just fine.</p>\n<p>&quot;It shouldn’t take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini,&quot; Zerzan said. The plan is to compress the timeline in which transportation regulations are written and reviewed. The department has already used AI to draft an unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule.</p>\n<p>Federal agencies have used AI for years, but not to actually write regulations. It's primarily been used for the purpose of translating documents, analyzing data and categorizing public comments. Trump, however, is a huge <a href=\"https://www.ai.gov/\"><ins>proponent of the technology</ins></a>. He has released multiple executive orders <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/\"><ins>in support of AI</ins></a> and once shared an AI-created video in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/trump-ai-video-no-kings\"><ins>he flew a fighter jet</ins></a> and dropped what appears to be feces on American citizens.</p>\n<p>Skeptics say that large language models like Gemini shouldn't be in charge of drafting complicated and consequential regulations that impact millions of everyday Americans. Mistakes could lead to lawsuits and even injuries and deaths.</p>\n<p>Mike Horton, DOT’s former acting chief artificial intelligence officer, said using Gemini to draft regulations was like “having a high school intern that’s doing your rulemaking.” He also said that agency leaders under Trump &quot;want to go fast and break things, but going fast and breaking things means people are going to get hurt.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Just because these tools can produce a lot of words doesn’t mean that those words add up to a high-quality government decision,” said Bridget Dooling, a professor at Ohio State University who studies administrative law. “It’s so tempting to try to figure out how to use these tools, and I think it would make sense to try. But I think it should be done with a lot of skepticism.&quot;</p>\n<p>DOT has experienced a net loss of more than 4,000 employees since Trump started his second term. This includes <a href=\"https://data.opm.gov/explore-data/analytics/workforce-changes\"><ins>over 100 attorneys</ins></a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/trump-admin-reportedly-plans-to-use-ai-to-write-federal-regulations-175155111.html?src=rss",

The European Commission’s investigation could result in “further enforcement steps” against X, not long after it levied a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/x-hit-with-140-million-fine-from-the-eu-161259324.html\" target=\"_blank\">$140 million fine</a> against the platform.</p><p>“Sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation.
