That is why we are considering quickly imposing interim measures on Meta, to preserve access for competitors to WhatsApp while the investigation is ongoing, and avoid Meta’s new policy irreparably harming competition in Europe.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The issue arose in October when Meta announced updates to its WhatsApp Business Solution Terms. According to the European Commission, the January 15 update would &quot;effectively&quot; make <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-ai-is-coming-to-europe-this-week-113019014.html\">Meta AI</a> the only AI assistant available on WhatsApp. The regulatory agency <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2896\">opened an investigation</a> into the matter on December 4.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today's update stands as a warning to Meta that the European Commission initially believes the company has violated antitrust regulation. A final decision is still to come. It also gave Meta a chance to respond to the allegations — which it swiftly did.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;The facts are ‍that there is no reason for the EU to ​intervene in the WhatsApp ‌Business API,&quot; a Meta spokesperson <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/meta-criticises-eu-antitrust-move-against-whatsapp-block-ai-rivals-2026-02-09/\">told <em>Reuters</em></a>. &quot;There are many AI options and people can use them from app stores, operating ⁠systems, devices, websites, ​and industry ​partnerships.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-warns-meta-over-blocking-rival-ai-chatbots-on-whatsapp-121708895.html?src=rss",

In the latest <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-\">Power On report</a>, Gurman said that the iPhone 17e is &quot;due imminently&quot; and will keep the same price as its predecessor.</p>\n<p>Considering we’re about a year away from the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\">iPhone 16e</a>’s announcement, we’re due for a successor to Apple’s more affordable smartphone. According to Gurman, Apple upgraded the new budget-friendly iPhone with MagSafe charging and the A19 chip that's seen in the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-17-review-closer-to-pro-110055511.html\">iPhone 17 base model</a>.

However, for the same $599 price, Apple's iPhone 17e is getting a few notable upgrades and will compete with Google's <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/you-can-pre-order-the-pixel-10a-on-february-18-180712018.html\">Pixel 10a</a>. More specifically, Gurman expects Apple to target the emerging economies and enterprise demographics with the iPhone 17e. While Apple faces a lot more competition in overseas markets, iPhone sales have been experiencing a resurgence in <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-iphones-made-a-surprising-comeback-in-china/\">China</a>.

The bill would require the Department of Environmental Conservation and Public Service Commissions to issue impact statements and reports during the pause, along with any new orders or regulations that they deem necessary to minimize <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/why-do-ai-data-centers-use-so-many-resources-171500010.html\" target=\"_blank\">data centers' impacts</a> on the environment and consumers in New York.</p><p>The bill would require these departments to study data centers' water, electricity and gas usage, and their impact on the rates of these resources, among other things. The bill, citing a <em>Bloomberg</em> analysis, notes that, &quot;Nationally, household electricity rates increased 13 percent in 2025, largely driven by the development of data centers.&quot; New York is the sixth state this year to introduce a bill aiming to put the brakes on data centers, following in the footsteps of Georgia, Maryland, Oklahoma, Vermont and Virginia, according to <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=fc65353f-45dc-4cd0-89be-ac2071680abb&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=7c2d37d0-44ef-4d31-9f79-34822b342bc5&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=WIRED&amp;linkText=Wired&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aXJlZC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3LXlvcmstaXMtdGhlLWxhdGVzdC1zdGF0ZS10by1jb25zaWRlci1hLWRhdGEtY2VudGVyLXBhdXNlLyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiN2MyZDM3ZDAtNDRlZi00ZDMxLTlmNzktMzQ4MjJiMzQyYmM1Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy53aXJlZC5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3LXlvcmstaXMtdGhlLWxhdGVzdC1zdGF0ZS10by1jb25zaWRlci1hLWRhdGEtY2VudGVyLXBhdXNlLyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAePtarUFK8VikT5e-kh-uyeEnZXZq3j1Ar7KSwgmB8w3&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fstory%2Fnew-york-is-the-latest-state-to-consider-a-data-center-pause%2F\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wired</em></a>.

Siri is the default voice assistant for things like controlling music and looking up directions, but future AI apps in CarPlay could handle the complicated, open-ended requests Siri can't answer.</p><p>The expanded support would let developers like OpenAI or Google offer versions of their ChatGPT and Gemini apps for CarPlay. Similar functionality is possible just by connecting a smartphone to a car over Bluetooth and using an AI app's voice mode, but CarPlay support would presumably make the process a little more seamless.&nbsp;</p><p>Not so seamless that it replaces Siri, however. <em>Bloomberg</em> writes that these third-party apps won't be able to replace the Siri button in the CarPlay interface or use their own wake words (&quot;Hey Google,&quot; etc.). Instead, anyone who wants to spend a long drive talking to Gemini will have to open the app first. That could cut down on the utility of using one of these apps, but Apple presumably wants to get Siri to a place where CarPlay users prefer it as their in-car assistant anyway.</p><p>Apple and Google <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-siri-ai-will-be-powered-by-gemini-153636649.html\" target=\"_blank\">recently announced</a> that Gemini would power future versions of Siri and Apple Foundation Models, the AI models underpinning Apple Intelligence.

Reports suggest Apple wants to eventually use Google's Gemini models to transform Siri into <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-is-reportedly-overhauling-siri-to-be-an-ai-chatbot-205303818.html\" target=\"_blank\">a proper conversational chatbot</a>, too.
