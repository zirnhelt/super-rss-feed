It’s also apparently 50 percent louder and has a new, higher-pitched chime. Still no keyring hole, though.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>The new AirTag looks… the same. It’s arguably the most understated hardware design Apple has ever made, with no buttons or ports, just a company logo on one side. It’s made from a combination of a stainless steel plate and a (now 85-percent recycled) plastic enclosure. It’s like a thick coin, a little bigger than a quarter, and slips into any small pocket or wallet. The battery can be <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html\" target=\"_blank\">replaced by rotating the backing off</a>, but it's still solid enough that I never felt there was a risk of coming off accidentally.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apple’s accessories to attach the AirTag to your keys are still more expensive than the tracker itself. However, compared to when the original tracker launched, there’s now a rich collection of third-party options from the likes of Mophie, Belkin and more, many of which are more reasonably priced at around $15.

Pull out the plastic tag, connecting the battery, and a notification will pop up on your nearby iPhone. You can then name it, assign it to an item and it’ll join your list of findable Apple hardware.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I’ve been testing the range of the new AirTag, and if anything, the 50 percent increase in Precision Finding range is a conservative estimate. Naturally, tracking can be affected by building structure, walls, a lack of nearby Find My network devices and other interference, but the next-generation AirTag’s “getting closer” screen consistently appeared on my phone when I was around 80 feet away. The older tracker, however, needed me to be around 30-40 feet away to do the same. The benefit of Precision Finding was limited on the debut AirTag, because its range was so tiny — especially in busy environments. The hardware upgrades now make it truly useful. The new AirTag is also faster to connect and more responsive to my movements and sudden turns, thanks, I expect, to the new ultra-wideband chip.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can now also use newer Apple Watches (Series 9, Ultra 2 and up) with precision location detection. After updating her Apple Watch Series 11 to the latest software, my colleague Cherlynn Low reported that locating the new AirTag was pretty much the same as on an iPhone. She did find it slightly counterintuitive to have to first add the Find My shortcut to the Control Center on the watch instead of going to the Find My Items app to do so, but ultimately, once she did that, it mirrored the existing setup for Precision Finding on iPhones.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Apple's new AirTag promises increased range and a louder ring chime.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/airtag5.jpg\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Apple's new AirTag promises increased range and a louder ring chime.\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Mat Smith for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>Apple also redesigned the AirTag’s speaker assembly, which it says makes sounds 50 percent louder. Possibly the most effective audio upgrade is a higher-pitched chime that’s easier to hear over ambient noise and in busy public spaces. I could hear it ringing out from the other side of my gym’s locker room, while inside a locker, over music playing in the background. My old AirTag was inaudible until I was a few feet away from my locker. I always thought the sound on the original AirTag was a little too low-key for something you were urgently trying to find. (I’d love to be able to customize the chime, though.)</p>\n<p>It’s the Find My network that makes the AirTag shine. Apple’s massive footprint of over a billion devices, from iPhones to Macs, continues to offer a tracking range and finer precision than GPS and Bluetooth alone. If anything, this network is even more built out since the launch of the first Apple tracker.</p>\n<p>Since we tested the first AirTag, Apple has added multiple new features, usually through iOS updates, that expanded the utility and versatility of its trackers. In iOS 17, you could share an AirTag through Family Sharing. In iOS 18.2, Share Item Location allowed you to share your tracking information with third parties (such as airlines or train companies), improving the chances of finding the AirTag.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There have also been subsequent safety upgrades, including expanding unknown tracker alerts to Android devices without needing to install an app. Apple also reduced the time an AirTag takes to emit a sound when separated from its owner, shifting the interval to a random range between 8 and 24 hours. At launch, this was a three-day span.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Apple's second-gen AirTag.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/airtag9.jpg\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Apple's second-gen AirTag is still $29.\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Mat Smith for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>Do you need the new AirTag? While improved in every way, it’s pretty much the same device. However, the AirTag’s simplicity and ease of use are second to none when it comes to Bluetooth trackers. If you already own a single AirTag for your keys or wallet, upgrading to the second-gen iteration and repurposing the old one to track, say, your luggage, makes a lot of sense. You get the more precise location tracking and sensing for your smaller item, while you can reduce your bag anxiety if your suitcase doesn’t make it to your destination.</p>\n<p>There's no doubt the second-gen AirTags are improved, and thankfully, upgrading to the new capabilities doesn’t come at too steep a cost. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html?src=rss",

The best VR headsets today are gateways to fully realized experiences, whether that’s gaming, fitness, creative work or simply spending time inside a richly rendered virtual world. As the hardware has improved, so has the sense of presence, with sharper displays, wider fields of view and tracking systems that make movement feel more natural and responsive. The result is VR that feels less like a novelty and more like a platform you can actually spend time in.<br /><br />That said, not every headset is built for the same function. Some prioritize ease of use and standalone play, while others demand a powerful PC in exchange for higher fidelity. Compatibility also matters more than ever, especially as VR begins to overlap with mixed reality and early smart glasses experiments. Whether you want a simple way to explore virtual spaces or a high-end rig that pushes immersion as far as possible, this guide breaks down the best VR headsets you can buy in 2026 and explains who each one is really for.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-table-of-contents\">Table of contents</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-best-vr-headsets-for-2026\">Best VR headsets for 2026</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-how-we-test-vr-headsets\">How we test VR headsets</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-other-vr-headsets-weve-tested\">Other VR headsets we've tested</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-vr-headset-faqs\">VR headset FAQs</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"#jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-vr-headsets-for-2026\">Best VR headsets for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-vr-headsets\">How we test VR headsets</h2> \n<p>I tend to judge candidates for the best VR headset on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It's not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto it. But it takes real design skill to craft something that's well balanced, includes a supportive headstrap, and doesn't feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>My test for ergonomics is fairly simple: How long can I wear a headset until I start to feel discomfort? For the most ergonomic devices, like the Quest 3, that could easily be an hour or two. But heavier PC hardware often feels cumbersome after just 15 minutes — you won’t find those kinds of devices in our list of the best VR headsets.</p> \n<p>Immersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, like a 120Hz refresh rate, helping users feel fully present inside a virtual world. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. A narrow FOV makes it feel like you're peering through a pair of binoculars, which limits your sense of “presence.” The best VR headsets aim for a wider field of view, helping virtual environments feel more natural and fully surround you.</p> \n<p>A wide field of view, on the other hand, can make it seem like you’re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth. We look at a few popular video games, like <em>Superhot</em>, <em>Beat Saber </em>and <em>Pistol Whip</em>, on every headset to judge how immersed we feel and how enjoyable the gaming experience is overall.</p> \n<p>The best controllers fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has basically adopted the design of Meta’s excellent touch controllers, but we're also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve's finger tracking gamepads. We judge controllers based on how easy they are to hold, how they hold up to sweaty gameplay sessions and how easily headsets can track their position in space.</p> \n<p>However, it’s important to look at a virtual reality headset’s specs as a whole, including compatibility with your existing hardware and the kind of experiences you plan to use it for. Depending on what you’re looking for in yourVR headset, you’ll want to consider factors like your PC’s CPU and graphics card if you plan to use the headset to play the best VR games. You might not need a super powerful PC, but you should check the minimum requirements for the headset you’re looking to purchase. If you’re not looking to invest in a VR headset solely for gaming, features like head tracking allow you to explore your environment just by simply moving your head in the simulator. This often results in a more immersive and realistic experience.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-vr-headsets-weve-tested\">Other VR headsets we’ve tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-htc-vive-focus-vision\">HTC Vive Focus Vision</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/htc-vive-focus-vision-review-a-premium-vr-headset-with-average-performance-150029763.html\">Vive Focus Vision</a> is a sleek premium standalone VR headset that can also deliver solid PC VR. But it’s also running aging hardware, it’s riddled with software issues and it’s expensive compared to the Meta Quest 3.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-meta-quest-pro\">Meta Quest Pro</h3> \n<p>As great as the Meta Quest 3 is, the Quest 2 is still a very good entry-level VR headset, and it’s worth considering if it’s on sale below its current $250 list price. The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-pro-review-a-next-gen-headset-for-the-vr-faithful-specs-price-130045313-130045431.html\">Meta Quest Pro</a>, on the the hand, is an expensive boondoggle best ignored.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-htc-vive-pro-2\">HTC Vive Pro 2</h3> \n<p>Outside of Meta’s hardware, the HTC <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685-133000767.html\">Vive Pro 2</a> remains a fantastic PC headset, but it’s far more expensive than the Valve Index, which is more comfortable and offers better audio.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-vr-headset-faqs\">VR headset FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-vr-headsets-work\">How do VR headsets work?</h3> \n<p>At the most basic level, a VR headset is simply a high quality screen that you’re holding up to your face. For a wired headset, the actual work of rendering a game is done on either a PC or game console. For completely wireless devices, like the Meta Quest 3, that work is handled right on the headset. They rely on either external sensors, or sensors built into the headsets, to map your physical space. While you can use a traditional gamepad or keyboard and mouse in VR, they typically use motion tracking controllers to immerse you in their 3D environments.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-vr-headset-is-best-for-full-body-tracking\">What VR headset is best for full body tracking?</h3> \n<p>While we’re still waiting for a truly great haptic VR bodysuit to arrive, you can still achieve accurate body tracking with most Steam VR-compatible PC headsets. The Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro 2 both rely on room-tracking sensors that can map your body more effectively than the built-in sensors on competitors. You can also add HTC Vive Trackers to wrist and leg straps, as well as belts, for even better coverage. The Meta Quest 3 doesn’t have any easy body tracking solutions, but you can <a href=\"https://www.vr-wave.store/blogs/virtual-reality-prescription-lenses/get-full-body-tracking-on-your-quest-2\">add Vive trackers when it’s plugged into your PC</a> to mimic a Steam VR headset.</p> \n<p>Only a few experiences, like VRChat, take advantage of full body tracking at the moment. Currently there aren’t any body tracking solutions for the PlayStation VR and VR2, but we’re intrigued by the company’s <a href=\"https://www.vr-wave.store/blogs/virtual-reality-prescription-lenses/get-full-body-tracking-on-your-quest-2\">Mocopi body trackers</a>, which were really announced in Japan.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-vr-headsets-are-better-than-oculus\">What VR headsets are better than Oculus?</h3> \n<p>Oculus is the previous name for Meta’s VR hardware. Currently, Meta only supports the Quest 3, Quest 3S and Quest Pro, all of which are wireless headsets. As we explain above, PC VR headsets can generally achieve better quality virtual reality, since they rely on more powerful graphics hardware.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-vr-headsets-work-with-xbox\">What VR headsets work with Xbox?</h3> \n<p>Currently, Microsoft’s Xbox consoles don’t support any VR headsets.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>November 2025:</strong> Updated to include the Apple Vision Pro M5.</p> \n<p><strong>April 2025:</strong> Updated to include review scores for our top picks, where applicable.</p> \n<p><strong>November 2024:</strong> Added the HTC Vive Focus Vision to the &quot;others we tested&quot; section.</p> \n<p><strong>October 2024:</strong> Updated our &quot;best cheap VR headset&quot; top pick to be the Meta Quest 3S.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/best-vr-headsets-140012529.html?src=rss",

Today, the US Department of Justice filed notice of a plan to cross-appeal the decision last fall that Google would <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-doesnt-have-to-sell-chrome-judge-in-monopoly-case-rules-211032326.html\" target=\"_blank\">not be required</a> to sell off the its Chrome browser.

Judge Amit Mehta denied the request from the agency. &quot;Plaintiffs overreached in seeking forced divesture of these key assets, which Google did not use to effect any illegal restraints,&quot; Mehta's decision stated. However, he did set other restrictions on Google's business activities, such as an end to exclusive deals for distributing some services and a requirement to share select search data with competitors.</p><p>Google has already <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-is-appealing-the-ruling-from-its-search-antitrust-case-to-avoid-sharing-data-with-rivals-215107905.html\" target=\"_blank\">filed its own appeal</a> over this part of its ongoing antitrust battle.

The new release expands on the AI features the company introduced with Xcode 26 at WWDC 2025 to give systems like Claude and ChatGPT more robust access to its in-house IDE.&nbsp;</p><p>With the update, Apple says Claude and OpenAI's Codex &quot;can search documentation, explore file structures, update project settings, and verify their work visually by capturing Xcode Previews and iterating through builds and fixes.&quot; This is in contrast to earlier releases of Xcode 26 where those same agents were limited in what they could see of a developer's Xcode environment, restricting their utility. According to Apple, the change will give users tools they can use to streamline their processes and work more efficiently than before. </p><p>Developers can add Claude and Codex to their Xcode terminal from the Intelligence section of the app's setting menu. Once a provider is selected, the interface allows users to also pick their preferred model. So if you like the outputs of say GPT 5.1 over GPT 5.2, you can use the older system.&nbsp;</p><p>The tighter integration with Claude and Codex was made possible by Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers Apple has deployed. MCP is a technology Anthropic debuted in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\" target=\"_blank\">fall 2024</a> to make it easier for large language models like Claude to share data with third-party tools and systems. Since its introduction, MCP has become an industry standard — with OpenAI, for instance, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://community.openai.com/t/introducing-support-for-remote-mcp-servers-image-generation-code-interpreter-and-more-in-the-responses-api/1266973\" target=\"_blank\">adopting the protocol</a> last year to facilitate its own set of connections.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple says it worked directly with Anthropic and OpenAI to optimize token usage through Xcode, but the company’s adoption of MCP means developers will be able to add any coding agent that supports the protocol to their terminal in the future. Xcode 26.3 is available to download for all members of the Apple Developer Program starting today, with the Mac Store availability “coming soon.”   </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-just-made-xcode-better-for-vibe-coding-195653049.html?src=rss",

It led to users downloading compromised executables that could infect their devices. Now, Don Ho has revealed that multiple security experts investigated the breach and determined that the threat actor “is likely a Chinese state-sponsored group.” He said it explained why experts observed highly selective targeting during the campaign and why only traffic from certain users were redirected so that they would download malicious files. It’s not clear what kind of users were specifically targeted and what the files did to their devices.</p><p>The attackers started redirecting traffic from Notepad++ to their servers sometime in June 2025, and that went on until December 2. Their method involved compromising the system at the hosting provider level, though the exact technical mechanism that allowed them to intercept traffic remains under investigation. In addition to releasing a security patch, Notepad++ also  migrated to a new hosting provider with much stronger security practices. Ho now encourages anyone who wants to install the app to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/v8.9.1/\" target=\"_blank\">download version 8.9.1</a>, which comes with the security update, and running the installer manually. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/notepad-says-it-was-hijacked-by-chinese-state-sponsored-hackers-153000268.html?src=rss",

Thanks to a new 33MP partially stacked sensor, image quality is where it truly pulls ahead, offering best-in-class dynamic range and low-light performance that outclasses 24MP rivals despite the higher resolution. If your primary goal is capturing the perfect still, the combination of accurate AI autofocus and improved color science makes this arguably the best all-around Sony shooter yet.</p><p>However, if you’re a video-first creator, the A7 V might feel like it’s a little behind. While the 10-bit 4K footage is sharp and benefits from impressive AI auto-framing and stabilization, it lacks internal RAW recording, which competitors like the Canon R6 III and Panasonic S1 II now offer.
