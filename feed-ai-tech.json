      "content_html": "<p><p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. It’s been a very busy week of fun game releases (next week will be too!), so let’s get into some of them after a quick reflection on gaming while traveling.</p><p>I love my Steam Deck. I really truly do. It’s a fantastic machine. And yet when I brought it with me on a five-week trip over the holidays, I used it for barely an hour the entire time. That doesn’t really justify the space and weight it takes up in my bag. The same holds true for my Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation Portal.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll be leaving them all at home next time. I’ll take a small controller (probably <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/another-look-at-ohsnaps-mcon-a-magnetic-game-controller-for-your-phone-042424092.html\" target=\"_blank\">OhSnap's MCON</a>) so I can play the odd game on my laptop or phone. I’ll bring my Playdate as well. I adore that little yellow console, and I haven’t spent nearly enough time using it. I have a lot of neat-looking indie games to catch up on there (<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://play.date/games/diora/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Diora</em></a> looks particularly interesting). I’m more likely to play something on a flight if it’s on a device I can pull out from my pocket. I just wish Panic had put a backlight in the Playdate.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-new-releases\">New releases</h2><p></p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Massive Monster and publisher Devolver Digital gave <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cult-of-the-lamb-is-finally-getting-a-co-op-mode-but-its-local-only-180715026.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a><em> </em>fans a whole bunch of reasons to jump back into the game this week with the arrival of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cult-of-the-lambs-next-dlc-is-woolhaven-out-in-early-2026-225129643.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Woolhaven </em>expansion</a>. You'll need to get close to the end of the base game (though you don't need to beat the final boss) before you can experience what the DLC has to offer. It includes weather effects, a new mountain area with a pair of fresh dungeons, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/this-is-how-the-new-ranching-system-will-work-in-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-194324041.html\" target=\"_blank\">a ranching system</a> (which allows you to raise animals as pets or for food) and much more.</p><p>Folks who dig <em>Cult of the Lamb </em>seem to get really into the game. After a few years of free updates from Massive Monster, <em>Woolhaven </em>is a major expansion that's similar in scope to the base game, so it should keep fans busy for quite a while if they want to try everything. The DLC is out now on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3840050/Cult_of_the_Lamb_Woolhaven/\" target=\"_blank\">PC</a>, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. It costs $17 if you already have the base game.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Inkle, the studio behind <em>Overboard!</em> and the wonderful <em>A Highland Song</em> is back with <em>TR-49</em>, a puzzle game with a World War II computer at its core. Over five decades, an array of books, letters and journals were fed into the machine as part of an effort to &quot;crack the code of reality.&quot; But now you're tasked with finding and destroying one specific book before a timer runs out.</p><p>It all seems rather mysterious. To give you a sense of what's going on here, Inkle says it drew inspiration from narrative deduction games like <em>The Roottrees are Dead, The Return of the Obra Dinn </em>and <em>Her Story</em>, as well as audio dramas. I can't see myself having the time or patience to figure out the enigma of this particular machine (I imagine many players will need a notebook for this one), but I'm intrigued enough to at least watch a Let's Play at some point. You can experience this mystery for yourself on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3838370/TR49/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> (normally $7, but there's a 10 percent launch discount until January 28).</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Another week, another Metroidvania, but <em>MIO: Memories in Orbit </em>has a more striking art style than most. This game from Douze Dixièmes and publisher Focus Entertainment debuted to positive reviews this week. After the AI caretakers on a forgotten spaceship stop working, you'll have to help the robot MIO explore the spacecraft &quot;to revive its lost memories&quot; and save it from doom. Naturally, you'll discover some new abilities along the way, including a grappling hook and air gliding.</p><p><em>MIO: Memories in Orbit</em> is available on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010037\" target=\"_blank\">PS5</a>, <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86d78fd7-706f-45bc-8ccc-e3d69ab5f680&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9taW8tbWVtb3JpZXMtaW4tb3JiaXQvOW5wODZrNTdzcW0zIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmQ3OGZkNy03MDZmLTQ1YmMtOGNjYy1lM2Q2OWFiNWY2ODAiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL21pby1tZW1vcmllcy1pbi1vcmJpdC85bnA4Nms1N3NxbTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfWbXK45jmpjFawfpYsSR87Sl8iitEZNT22MkcoQFtF5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fmio-memories-in-orbit%2F9np86k57sqm3\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Series X/S</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mio-memories-in-orbit-switch\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mio-memories-in-orbit-switch-2\" target=\"_blank\">Switch 2</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1672810/MIO_Memories_in_Orbit/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>, the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/mio-memories-in-orbit-e46c84\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Store</a> and the Microsoft Store for $20 (with a 10 percent launch discount on some platforms).

      "summary": "<p>Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. It’s been a very busy week of fun game releases (next week will be too!), so let’s get into some of them after a quick reflection on gaming while traveling.</p><p>I love my Steam Deck. I really truly do. It’s a fantastic machine. And yet when I brought it with me on a five-week trip over the holidays, I used it for barely an hour the entire time. That doesn’t really justify the space and weight it takes up in my bag. The same holds true for my Nintendo Switch 2 and PlayStation Portal.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ll be leaving them all at home next time. I’ll take a small controller (probably <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/another-look-at-ohsnaps-mcon-a-magnetic-game-controller-for-your-phone-042424092.html\" target=\"_blank\">OhSnap's MCON</a>) so I can play the odd game on my laptop or phone. I’ll bring my Playdate as well. I adore that little yellow console, and I haven’t spent nearly enough time using it. I have a lot of neat-looking indie games to catch up on there (<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://play.date/games/diora/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Diora</em></a> looks particularly interesting). I’m more likely to play something on a flight if it’s on a device I can pull out from my pocket. I just wish Panic had put a backlight in the Playdate.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-new-releases\">New releases</h2><p></p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Massive Monster and publisher Devolver Digital gave <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cult-of-the-lamb-is-finally-getting-a-co-op-mode-but-its-local-only-180715026.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Cult of the Lamb</em></a><em> </em>fans a whole bunch of reasons to jump back into the game this week with the arrival of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cult-of-the-lambs-next-dlc-is-woolhaven-out-in-early-2026-225129643.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Woolhaven </em>expansion</a>. You'll need to get close to the end of the base game (though you don't need to beat the final boss) before you can experience what the DLC has to offer. It includes weather effects, a new mountain area with a pair of fresh dungeons, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/this-is-how-the-new-ranching-system-will-work-in-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-194324041.html\" target=\"_blank\">a ranching system</a> (which allows you to raise animals as pets or for food) and much more.</p><p>Folks who dig <em>Cult of the Lamb </em>seem to get really into the game. After a few years of free updates from Massive Monster, <em>Woolhaven </em>is a major expansion that's similar in scope to the base game, so it should keep fans busy for quite a while if they want to try everything. The DLC is out now on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3840050/Cult_of_the_Lamb_Woolhaven/\" target=\"_blank\">PC</a>, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. It costs $17 if you already have the base game.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Inkle, the studio behind <em>Overboard!</em> and the wonderful <em>A Highland Song</em> is back with <em>TR-49</em>, a puzzle game with a World War II computer at its core. Over five decades, an array of books, letters and journals were fed into the machine as part of an effort to &quot;crack the code of reality.&quot; But now you're tasked with finding and destroying one specific book before a timer runs out.</p><p>It all seems rather mysterious. To give you a sense of what's going on here, Inkle says it drew inspiration from narrative deduction games like <em>The Roottrees are Dead, The Return of the Obra Dinn </em>and <em>Her Story</em>, as well as audio dramas. I can't see myself having the time or patience to figure out the enigma of this particular machine (I imagine many players will need a notebook for this one), but I'm intrigued enough to at least watch a Let's Play at some point. You can experience this mystery for yourself on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3838370/TR49/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> (normally $7, but there's a 10 percent launch discount until January 28).</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Another week, another Metroidvania, but <em>MIO: Memories in Orbit </em>has a more striking art style than most. This game from Douze Dixièmes and publisher Focus Entertainment debuted to positive reviews this week. After the AI caretakers on a forgotten spaceship stop working, you'll have to help the robot MIO explore the spacecraft &quot;to revive its lost memories&quot; and save it from doom. Naturally, you'll discover some new abilities along the way, including a grappling hook and air gliding.</p><p><em>MIO: Memories in Orbit</em> is available on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010037\" target=\"_blank\">PS5</a>, <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=86d78fd7-706f-45bc-8ccc-e3d69ab5f680&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9taW8tbWVtb3JpZXMtaW4tb3JiaXQvOW5wODZrNTdzcW0zIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4NmQ3OGZkNy03MDZmLTQ1YmMtOGNjYy1lM2Q2OWFiNWY2ODAiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnhib3guY29tL2VuLVVTL2dhbWVzL3N0b3JlL21pby1tZW1vcmllcy1pbi1vcmJpdC85bnA4Nms1N3NxbTMifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfWbXK45jmpjFawfpYsSR87Sl8iitEZNT22MkcoQFtF5&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fmio-memories-in-orbit%2F9np86k57sqm3\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Series X/S</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mio-memories-in-orbit-switch\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mio-memories-in-orbit-switch-2\" target=\"_blank\">Switch 2</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1672810/MIO_Memories_in_Orbit/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>, the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/mio-memories-in-orbit-e46c84\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Store</a> and the Microsoft Store for $20 (with a 10 percent launch discount on some platforms).
