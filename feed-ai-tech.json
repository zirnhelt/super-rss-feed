Speaking to reporters in Taipei this weekend, Huang reportedly said it could be &quot;the largest investment we've ever made.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>NVIDIA and OpenAI jointly announced in September that NVIDIA would be <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-investing-up-to-100-billion-in-openai-to-build-10-gigawatts-of-ai-data-centers-175159134.html\" target=\"_blank\">investing up to $100 billion</a> in OpenAI to build 10 gigawatts of AI data centers. The companies said then that they were targeting the second half of 2026 for the first phase of the project to go online. Citing sources familiar with the discussions, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that Huang has highlighted privately that the agreement was nonbinding and has criticized OpenAI's business approach as lacking discipline.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, however, Huang called the report's claims &quot;nonsense,&quot; and told reporters on Saturday, &quot;I believe in OpenAI. The work that they do is incredible. They’re one of the most consequential companies of our time.” But, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports, he said NVIDIA's investment in this funding round wouldn't come near $100 billion.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nvidia-is-still-planning-to-make-a-huge-investment-in-openai-ceo-says-205521528.html?src=rss",
