It has a magnetic inductive charging interface, similar to the Apple Watch's charging mechanism.</p><p>Given the way Apple markets itself as a privacy-focused company, it will be interesting to see how the company pitches the public on what sounds like an incognito recording device.

The wearable is said to resemble a slightly thicker AirTag and include multiple cameras, a speaker, microphones, and wireless charging.</p><p>The report coincides with another <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-21/ios-27-apple-to-revamp-siri-as-built-in-iphone-mac-chatbot-to-fend-off-openai\" target=\"_blank\">from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that claims that Apple will revamp Siri as a ChatGPT-style chatbot. When combined with the recent announcement that <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-siri-ai-will-be-powered-by-gemini-153636649.html\" target=\"_blank\">Google's Gemini will power Siri AI</a>, it looks like the company is finally making a more defined play for a piece of the generative AI pie. On the other hand, the wearable pin is reportedly only in the very early stages and could still be canceled.</p><p>The pin is described as a thin, flat, circular disc with an aluminum and glass exterior. It includes two cameras (standard and wide-angle) for taking photos and videos of the user's surroundings. It also has three microphones. It includes a speaker and a physical button along one edge. It has a magnetic inductive charging interface, similar to the Apple Watch's charging mechanism.</p><p>Given the way Apple markets itself as a privacy-focused company, it will be interesting to see how the company pitches the public on what sounds like an incognito recording device. Although on that note, the App Store still hosts the Grok app, which egregiously violates privacy by <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/28-advocacy-groups-call-on-apple-and-google-to-ban-grok-x-over-nonconsensual-deepfakes-215048460.html\" target=\"_blank\">generating nearly-nude deepfakes of real people</a> — despite Apple's rules explicitly prohibiting such apps.</p><p><em>The Information</em> says Apple could release its AI pin as early as 2027. The company sounds confident in the device's appeal, as it reportedly plans to produce around 20 million units at launch.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/apple-is-reportedly-developing-a-wearable-ai-pin-204705065.html?src=rss",
