      "content_html": "<p>Today's links Google's AI pricing plan: From each according to their ability (to pay). Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Disney buys Pixar; Bruces on \"vernacular video\"; Hickey paralysis; RIP David Hartwell; Personalized pricing; They were warned. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Google's AI pricing plan (permalink) Google is spending a lot on AI, but what's not clear is how Google will make a lot from AI. Or, you know, even break even. Given, you know, that businesses are seeing zero return from AI: https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/20/pwc_ai_ceo_survey/ But maybe they've figured it out. In a recent edition of his BIG newsletter, Matt Stoller pulls on several of the strings that Google's top execs have dangled recently: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/will-google-organize-the-worlds-prices The first string: Google's going to spy on you a lot more, for the same reason Microsoft is spying on all of its users: because they want to supply their AI \"agents\" with your personal data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANECpNdt-4 Google's announced that it's going to feed its AI your Gmail messages, as well as the whole deep surveillance dossier the company has assembled based on your use of all the company's products: Youtube, Maps, Photos, and, of course, Search: https://twitter.com/Google/status/2011473059547390106 The second piece of news is that Apple has partnered with Google to supply Gemini to all iPhone users: https://twitter.com/NewsFromGoogle/status/2010760810751017017 Apple already charges Google more than $20b/year not to enter the search market; now they're going to be charging Google billions to stay out of the AI market, too. Meanwhile, Google will get to spy on Apple customers, just like they spy on their own users. Anyone who says that Apple is ideologically committed to your privacy because they're real capitalists is a sucker (or a cultist): https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/12/youre-holding-it-wrong/#if-dishwashers-were-iphones But the big revelation is how Google is going to make money with AI: they're going to sell AI-based \"personalized pricing\" to \"partners,\" including \"Walmart, Visa, Mastercard, Shopify, Gap, Kroger, Macy’s, Stripe, Home Depot, Lowe's, American Express, etc\": https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/agentic-commerce-ai-tools-protocol-retailers-platforms/ Personalized pricing, of course, is the polite euphemism for surveillance pricing, which is when a company spies on you in order to figure out how much they can get away with charging you (or how little they can get away with paying you): https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/# It's a weird form of cod-Marxism, whose tenet is \"From each according to their desperation; to each according to their vulnerability.\" Surveillance pricing advocates say that this is \"efficient\" because they can use surveillance data to offer you discounts, too &#8211; like, say you rock up to an airline ticket counter 45 minutes before takeoff and they can use surveillance data to know that you won't take their last empty seat for $200, but you would fly in it for $100, you could get that seat for cheap. This is, of course, nonsense. Airlines don't sell off cheap seats like bakeries discounting their day-olds &#8211; they jack up the price of a last-minute journey to farcical heights. Google also claims that it will only use its surveillance pricing facility to offer discounts, and not to extract premiums. As Stoller points out, there's a well-developed playbook for making premiums look like discounts, which is easy to see in the health industry. As Stoller says, the list price for an MRI is $8,000, but your insurer gets a $6000 \"discount\" and actually pays $1970, sticking you with a $30 co-pay. The $8000 is a fake number, and so is the $6000 &#8211; the only real price is the $30 you're paying. The whole economy is filled with versions of this transparent ruse, from \"department stores who routinely mark everything as 80% off\" to pharmacy benefit managers: https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/23/shield-of-boringness/#some-men-rob-you-with-a-fountain-pen Google, meanwhile, is touting its new \"universal commerce protocol\" (UCP), a way for AI \"agents\" to retrieve prices and product descriptions and make purchases: https://www.thesling.org/the-harm-to-consumers-and-sellers-from-universal-commerce-protocol-in-googles-own-words/ Right now, a major hurdle to \"agentic AI\" is the complexity of navigating websites designed for humans. AI agents just aren't very reliable when it comes to figuring out which product is which, choosing the correct options, and putting it in a shopping cart, and then paying for it. Some of that is merely because websites have inconsistent \"semantics\" &#8211; literally things like the \"buy\" button being called something other than \"buy button\" in the HTML code. But there's a far more profound problem with agentic shopping, which is that companies deliberately obfuscate their prices. This is how junk fees work, and why they're so destructive. Say you're a hotel providing your rate-card to an online travel website. You know that travelers are going to search for hotels by city and amenities, and then sort the resulting list by price. If you hide your final price &#8211; by surprising the user with a bunch of junk fees at checkout, or, better yet, after they arrive and put their credit-card down at reception &#8211; you are going to be at the top of that list. Your hotel will seem like the cheapest, best option. But of course, it's not. From Ticketmaster to car rentals, hotels to discount airlines, rental apartments to cellular plans, the real price is withheld until the very last instant, whereupon it shoots up to levels that are absolutely uncompetitive. But because these companies are able to engage in deceptive advertising, they look cheaper. And of course, crooked offers drive out honest ones. The honest hotel that provides a true rate card, reflecting the all-in price, ends up at the bottom of the price-sorted list, rents no rooms, and goes out of business (or pivots to lying about its prices, too). Online sellers do not want to expose their true prices to comparison shopping services. They benefit from lying to those services. For decades, technologists have dreamed of building a \"semantic web\" in which everyone exposes true and accurate machine-readable manifests of their content to facilitate indexing, search and data-mining: https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm This has failed. It's failed because lying is often more profitable than telling the truth, and because lying to computers is easier than lying to people, and because once a market is dominated by liars, everyone has to lie, or be pushed out of the market. Of course, it would be really cool if everyone diligently marked up everything they put into the public sphere with accurate metadata. But there are lots of really cool things you could do if you could get everyone else to change how they do things and arrange their affairs to your convenience. Imagine how great it would be if you could just get everyone to board an airplane from back to front, or to stand right and walk left on escalators, or to put on headphones when using their phones in public. Wanting it badly is not enough. People have lots of reasons for doing things in suboptimal ways. Often the reason is that it's suboptimal for you, but just peachy for them. Google says that it's going to get every website in the world to expose accurate rate cards to its chatbots to facilitate agentic AI. Google is also incapable of preventing \"search engine optimization\" companies from tricking it into showing bullshit at the top of the results for common queries: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/03/keyword-swarming/#site-reputation-abuse Google somehow thinks that the companies that spend millions of dollars trying to trick its crawler won't also spend millions of dollars trying to trick its chatbot &#8211; and they're providing the internet with a tool to inject lies straight into the chatbot's input hopper. But UCP isn't just a way for companies to tell Google what their prices are. As Stoller points out, UCP will also sell merchants the ability to have Gemini set prices on their products, using Google's surveillance data, through \"dynamic pricing\" (another euphemism for \"surveillance pricing\"). This decade has seen the rise and rise of price \"clearinghouses\" &#8211; companies that offer price \"consulting\" to direct competitors in a market. Nominally, this is just a case of two competitors shopping with the same supplier &#8211; like Procter and Gamble and Unilever buying their high-fructose corn-syrup from the same company. But it's actually far more sinister. \"Clearinghouses\" like Realpage &#8211; a company that \"advises\" landlords on rental rates &#8211; allow all the major competitors in a market to collude to raise prices in lockstep. A Realpage landlord that ignores the service's \"advice\" and gives a tenant a break on the rent will be excluded from Realpage's service. The rental markets that Realpage dominates have seen major increases in rental rates: https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/09/pricewars/#adam-smith-communist Google's \"direct pricing\" offering will allow all comers to have Google set their prices for them, based on Google's surveillance data. That includes direct competitors. As Stoller points out, both Nike and Reebok are Google advertisers. If they let Google price their sneakers, Google can raise prices across the market in lockstep. Despite how much everyone hates this garbage, neoclassical economists and their apologists in the legal profession continue to insist that surveillance pricing is \"efficient.\" Stoller points to a law review article called \"Antitrust After the Coming Wave,\" written by antitrust law prof and Google lawyer Daniel Crane: https://nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-99-number-4/antitrust-after-the-coming-wave/ Crane argues that AI will kill antitrust law because AI favors monopolies, and argues \"that we should forget about promoting competition or costs, and instead enact a new Soviet-style regime, one in which the government would merely direct a monopolist’s 'AI to maximize social welfare and allocate the surplus created among different stakeholders of the firm.'\" This is a planned economy, but it's one in which the planning is done by monopolists who are &#8211; somehow, implausibly &#8211; so biddable that governments can delegate the power to decide what we can buy and sell, what we can afford and who can afford it, and rein them in if they get it wrong. In 1890, Senator John Sherman was stumping for the Sherman Act, America's first antitrust law. On the Senate floor, he declared: If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity. https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/ Google thinks that it has finally found a profitable use for AI. It thinks that it will be the first company to make money on AI, by harnessing that AI to a market-rigging, price-gouging monopoly that turns Google's software into Sherman's \"autocrat of trade.\" It's funny when you think of all those \"AI safety\" bros who claimed that AI's greatest danger was that it would become sentient and devour us. It turns out that the real \"AI safety\" risk is that AI will automate price gouging at scale, allowing Google to crown itself a \"King over the necessaries of life\": https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space (Image: Noah_Loverbear; CC BY-SA 3.0; Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; modified) Hey look at this (permalink) The Line, a Saudi Megaproject, Is Dead https://www.thenation.com/article/world/the-line-neom-saudi-vision-2030/ Mark Carney's full speech at the World Economic Forum https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqHDhO4h10 A Grassroots Victory in the Golden Age of Bullies https://asupposedlylonething.net/blog/2026/grassroots-victory-golden-age-bullies/ AI may be everywhere, but it's nowhere in recent productivity statistics https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/forrester_ai_jobs_impact/ The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight Against Forgetting https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting Object permanence (permalink) #20yrsago Disney swaps stock for Pixar; Jobs is largest Disney stockholder https://web.archive.org/web/20060129105430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/01/22/cnpixar22.xml&#38;amp;menuId=242&#38;amp;sSheet=/money/2006/01/22/ixcitytop.html #20yrsago HOWTO anonymize your search history https://web.archive.org/web/20060220004353/https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70051-0.html #15yrsago Bruce Sterling talk on “vernacular video” https://vimeo.com/18977827 #15yrsago Elaborate televised prank on Belgium’s terrible phone company https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXlDyTD7wo #15yrsago Portugal: 10 years of decriminalized drugs https://web.archive.org/web/20110120040831/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/16/drug_experiment/?page=full #15yrsago Woman paralyzed by hickey https://web.archive.org/web/20110123072349/https://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/01/21/new-zealand-woman-partially-paralyzed-hickey/ #15yrsago EFF warns: mobile OS vendors aren’t serious about security https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/dont-sacrifice-security-mobile-devices #10yrsago Trumpscript: a programming language based on the rhetorical tactics of Donald Trump https://www.inverse.com/article/10448-coders-assimilate-donald-trump-to-a-programming-language #10yrsago That time the DoD paid Duke U $335K to investigate ESP in dogs.

Despite how much everyone hates this garbage, neoclassical economists and their apologists in the legal profession continue to insist that surveillance pricing is \"efficient.\" Stoller points to a law review article called \"Antitrust After the Coming Wave,\" written by antitrust law prof and Google lawyer Daniel Crane: https://nyulawreview.org/issues/volume-99-number-4/antitrust-after-the-coming-wave/ Crane argues that AI will kill antitrust law because AI favors monopolies, and argues \"that we should forget about promoting competition or costs, and instead enact a new Soviet-style regime, one in which the government would merely direct a monopolist’s 'AI to maximize social welfare and allocate the surplus created among different stakeholders of the firm.'\" This is a planned economy, but it's one in which the planning is done by monopolists who are &#8211; somehow, implausibly &#8211; so biddable that governments can delegate the power to decide what we can buy and sell, what we can afford and who can afford it, and rein them in if they get it wrong. In 1890, Senator John Sherman was stumping for the Sherman Act, America's first antitrust law. On the Senate floor, he declared: If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of any commodity. https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/20/we-should-not-endure-a-king/ Google thinks that it has finally found a profitable use for AI. It thinks that it will be the first company to make money on AI, by harnessing that AI to a market-rigging, price-gouging monopoly that turns Google's software into Sherman's \"autocrat of trade.\" It's funny when you think of all those \"AI safety\" bros who claimed that AI's greatest danger was that it would become sentient and devour us. It turns out that the real \"AI safety\" risk is that AI will automate price gouging at scale, allowing Google to crown itself a \"King over the necessaries of life\": https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/27/10-types-of-people/#taking-up-a-lot-of-space (Image: Noah_Loverbear; CC BY-SA 3.0; Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; modified) Hey look at this (permalink) The Line, a Saudi Megaproject, Is Dead https://www.thenation.com/article/world/the-line-neom-saudi-vision-2030/ Mark Carney's full speech at the World Economic Forum https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btqHDhO4h10 A Grassroots Victory in the Golden Age of Bullies https://asupposedlylonething.net/blog/2026/grassroots-victory-golden-age-bullies/ AI may be everywhere, but it's nowhere in recent productivity statistics https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/15/forrester_ai_jobs_impact/ The Long Now of the Web: Inside the Internet Archive’s Fight Against Forgetting https://hackernoon.com/the-long-now-of-the-web-inside-the-internet-archives-fight-against-forgetting Object permanence (permalink) #20yrsago Disney swaps stock for Pixar; Jobs is largest Disney stockholder https://web.archive.org/web/20060129105430/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2006/01/22/cnpixar22.xml&#38;amp;menuId=242&#38;amp;sSheet=/money/2006/01/22/ixcitytop.html #20yrsago HOWTO anonymize your search history https://web.archive.org/web/20060220004353/https://www.wired.com/news/technology/1,70051-0.html #15yrsago Bruce Sterling talk on “vernacular video” https://vimeo.com/18977827 #15yrsago Elaborate televised prank on Belgium’s terrible phone company https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxXlDyTD7wo #15yrsago Portugal: 10 years of decriminalized drugs https://web.archive.org/web/20110120040831/http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/01/16/drug_experiment/?page=full #15yrsago Woman paralyzed by hickey https://web.archive.org/web/20110123072349/https://www.foxnews.com/health/2011/01/21/new-zealand-woman-partially-paralyzed-hickey/ #15yrsago EFF warns: mobile OS vendors aren’t serious about security https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/dont-sacrifice-security-mobile-devices #10yrsago Trumpscript: a programming language based on the rhetorical tactics of Donald Trump https://www.inverse.com/article/10448-coders-assimilate-donald-trump-to-a-programming-language #10yrsago That time the DoD paid Duke U $335K to investigate ESP in dogs.

      "content_html": "<p>Today's links The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating ungovernability as a habit: Get good at being on hold. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: \"Ventus\"; Woody Guthrie v Trump's dad; Tory MP v poppers. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating ungovernability as a habit (permalink) I am on record as being skeptical of the notion that if you shop very carefully, you can make society better. \"Conscious consumption\" is not a tool for structural change, and any election that requires you to \"vote with your wallet\" is always won by the people with the thickest wallets (statistically speaking, that's not you): https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/13/consumption-choices/#marginal-benefits Now, that's not to say that boycotts are useless. But a boycott is a structured and organized campaign. The Montgomery bus boycott wasn't a matter of a bunch of people waking up one morning and saying, \"You know what, fuck it, I'm gonna walk today\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott The Montgomery bus boycott was an organized project, put together by a powerful membership organization, the NAACP, that demanded far more of its members than merely shopping very carefully. The boycott was the end stage of an organized resistance, not a substitute for it. The problem with \"conscious consumption\" is that it comes out of the neoliberal tradition in which every political matter is supposedly determined by your individual actions, and not your actions as part of a union or other political institution that works as a bloc to overthrow the status quo. \"Conscious consumption\" arises out of the tradition that gave us Margaret Thatcher's maxim, \"There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.\" Any attempt to change society by shopping very carefully is destined to fail, but it's worse than that. Because \"shopping very carefully\" never makes systemic change, its practitioners inevitably decide the reason they're not seeing the change they yearn for is that their allies aren't shopping carefully enough. This turns the careful shopper into a cop who polices other people's consumption, demanding that they stop eating some foodstuff or using Twitter or watching HBO Max. Squabbling over whether using a social media network makes you a Nazi generates far more heat than light &#8211; so much heat that it incinerates the solidarity you need to actually fight Nazis. Which is not an argument against boycotts! Boycotts work. If boycotts didn't work, then genocide apologists wouldn't be apoplectic over the BDS movement: https://bdsmovement.net/ But a \"boycott\" isn't the same thing as \"you and your social circle deciding that buying the wrong product makes you a Bad Person and then devoting your energies to scolding your allies for choosing Coke instead of Pepsi.\" Boycotts are downstream of organizing; they are not a substitute for organizing. There is such a thing as society. Now, all that said, I will confess: I sometimes do something that looks a lot like \"shopping very carefully,\" and when I do, I derive enormous satisfaction from it (but I am always careful not to mistake my tiny victories for political action). But I get it, honestly, I do. Sometimes, \"shopping very carefully\" is a way to eke out a tiny, personal victory in the face of overwhelming odds against a wildly overmatched opponent. That feels very good. One example would be patronizing my local repair shop (or fixing my stuff myself). The big structural barriers to repair are things like \"parts pairing\": https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification And manufacturers who abuse trademark law to get CBP to seize refurbished parts at the border: https://www.shacknews.com/article/108049/apple-repair-critic-louis-rossmann-takes-on-us-customs-counterfeit-battery-seizure The repair problem isn't that your neighbors are \"sheeple\" who've had their minds warped by a \"throwaway society.\" The problem is that technical and legal countermeasures have made repair so hard and unprofitable that getting your stuff fixed is more expensive and time-consuming than it needs to be. That said: I love going to my local repair shop. I love fixing things on my own. It's great. It makes me feel great. I think you should do it because it may make you feel great, too, and it'd be nice for you to support your local fix-it place, but let's not pretend that we'll change society that way. Here's another example: for the past couple years, I've been navigating a (thankfully very treatable) cancer diagnosis. The fact that my cancer is very treatable doesn't mean it's easily treated. America's shitty, for-profit healthcare system is terrible at the best of times, and nearly unnavigable when coping with a complex condition that crosses a lot of disciplinary lines and requires access to specialized, expensive equipment. I'm asymptomatic, so the hardest part of having cancer &#8211; so far &#8211; is fighting the Kaiser bureaucracy to make sure my treatment goes off as planned: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/05/carcinoma-angels/#squeaky-nail The fact that the different Kaiser departments drop so many balls when handing off care between them means that I have to juggle those balls for them. I make extensive use of organizational tactics like \"suspense files,\" which are a kind of inverted to-do list, in that they let you manage other people's to-do lists, rather than your own: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo (In case you're wondering, the best part of having cancer is that Kaiser comps 100% of your parking! Free cancer parking!) Now, I also make sure to note each of Kaiser's failures and I raise grievances and California health ombudsman complaints for each one &#8211; not because I'm angry and want an apology, but because I'm a well-organized, native English-speaking cancer patient with no symptoms, which means that I can do the advocacy that other people can't, and help them (I also track these complaints with suspense files, calendar entries, etc, to make sure that they're followed through). Partly, I'm able to do this because I'm very organized. I'm not organized because I worship at the cult of \"personal productivity\"; I'm definitely Jenny Odell-pilled on that score: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/ I'm organized because I pursue The Way of Jim Munroe's \"Time Management for Anarchists\" (\"once I learned how to make my own structure, I was able to kick my expensive boss habit and work on my own\"): https://jimmunroe.net/comics/pamphlets/time_management_for_anarchists/time_management_for_anarchists.html Having invested a lot of energy into being organized, I now get massive discounts on dealing with other people's shit. Remember: giant corporations and other remorseless bureaucracies throw up roadblocks on the assumption that you will be a \"rational economic actor.\" The airline assumes that if it costs you 15 hours to collect on the $50 voucher you're entitled to, you will just let them steal $50 from you. But once you get organized enough, you can cut that 15-hour investment down to a 15-minute one, and I will absolutely trade 15 minutes of dealing with an airline's bullshit for $50 of that airline's money. (Why yes, Air Canada did fuck me over on Jan 3 and get me home at 5AM the next day, instead of 730PM the night before; and yes, they did deny my compensation claim; and yes, I have filed an appeal with the Canada Transport Agency; why do you ask?) One of my favorite podcasts is \"An Arm and a Leg,\" which divides itself between deep dive structural analyses into how corrupt and ghastly American medical billing is, and enumerations of sweet hacks that ninja bill-fighters have come up with to slice through the billing labyrinth your insurer and hospital trap you in and cut straight to the bullseye: https://armandalegshow.com/ For example, the latest episode tells the story of Jared Walker, who figured out that hospitals were stealing billions of dollars every year from the poorest people in America, who were all entitled to have their medical bill canceled. He founded Dollarfor, a nonprofit that helps patients get their medical debt canceled: https://armandalegshow.com/episode/our-favorite-project-of-2025-levels-up-and-you-can-help/ Dollarfor now has an automated tool that guides you through a survey and then generates and files the completed, hospital-specific paperwork needed to get your medical debt canceled (they've made versions of this for every hospital in America!): https://dollarfor.org/ (If you're a health worker, here's a printable guide with QR codes that you can clip to your lanyard and show to patients while you deliver care): https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cfwK66A_mfBBBqn35_Lp7930uoY-73f/view Now, the real problem here isn't that hospitals steal billions from charity cases: it's that America has a garbage for-profit healthcare system that kills and bankrupts people at scale. Dollarfor is amazing, but it's not going to fix that problem. I don't know Walker, but I bet if you asked him, he'd agree with this, and say something like, \"Yes, and I'm helping people not have their lives destroyed by this garbage system, which is good unto itself; and also, it might give them the free time and wherewithal to participate in movements to overthrow the garbage system.\" I really dote on the fact that Dollarfor has literally built a different version of their tool for every single hospital in the country. It's a perfect example of how turning yourself into a highly organized adversary can overcome the time-based economics our enemies rely on to keep their garbage systems intact. Whenever I think of this stuff, I flash on two pop-culture references that made a deep impression on me. The first comes from 1985's Real Genius, Val Kilmer's best ever movie (fight me!). Real Genius is set at a fictionalized version of Caltech in which young prodigies slowly discover that their scumbag prof has tricked them into working on a weapons contract for the DoD. This being fictional-Caltech, there are all these scenes in which very smart people do weird and amazing things. At one point, we learn that there's a former child prodigy living in the basement under the dorms, a guy named Lazlo Hollyfeld who became a hermit after discovering that he, too, had been duped into working on a baby-killer project. We get these tantalizing glimpses of Lazlo in his subterranean redoubt, where he has built some kind of giant Rube Goldberg machine that is engaged in a mysterious mechanical process that involves manipulating cards of some sort. At the film's denouement (spoiler alert for a 40 year old movie), we discover what he was doing: Lazlo: These are entries into the Frito-Lay Sweepstakes. \"No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want\" &#8211; so I am. Chris: That's great! How many times? Lazlo: Well, this batch makes it one million six hundred and fifty thousand. I should win thirty-two point six percent of the prizes, including the car. Chris: That kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it? Lazlo: They set up the rules, and lately I've come to realize that I have certain materialistic needs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6kBfBXZBdc Then there's a scene from the otherwise tepid (fight me!) Batman Returns (1992) in which we encounter the Penguin in his subterranean redoubt, brandishing pages full of kompromat that have been laboriously taped together: The Penguin: What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham City? Maximillian 'Max' Shreck: If there were such documents &#8211; and that's not an admission &#8211; I would have seen to it they were shredded. The Penguin: Ah, good idea! [pulls out a sheaf of documents] The Penguin: A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/quotes/ Both Lazlo and the Penguin are defeating the time-based security assumptions of their adversaries. Frito Lay treats filling in 1.65m sweepstakes entries as the same thing as filling in infinity entries; Max Schrek treats the time needed to piece together shredded paper as infinite. Rounding a very large number up to infinity isn't entirely irrational, but once you get organized enough, you just might be able to find the time &#8211; or a system &#8211; to bring that very big number down to an entirely tractable value. Yes, this is a species of \"careful shopping\" but my point isn't to say that shopping carefully is useless &#8211; rather, that it's a drastic error to mistake this useful (and surprisingly satisfying) tactic for a strategy that will truly alter the system.

      "summary": "Today's links The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating ungovernability as a habit: Get good at being on hold. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: \"Ventus\"; Woody Guthrie v Trump's dad; Tory MP v poppers. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. The petty (but undeniable) delights of cultivating ungovernability as a habit (permalink) I am on record as being skeptical of the notion that if you shop very carefully, you can make society better. \"Conscious consumption\" is not a tool for structural change, and any election that requires you to \"vote with your wallet\" is always won by the people with the thickest wallets (statistically speaking, that's not you): https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/13/consumption-choices/#marginal-benefits Now, that's not to say that boycotts are useless. But a boycott is a structured and organized campaign. The Montgomery bus boycott wasn't a matter of a bunch of people waking up one morning and saying, \"You know what, fuck it, I'm gonna walk today\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott The Montgomery bus boycott was an organized project, put together by a powerful membership organization, the NAACP, that demanded far more of its members than merely shopping very carefully. The boycott was the end stage of an organized resistance, not a substitute for it. The problem with \"conscious consumption\" is that it comes out of the neoliberal tradition in which every political matter is supposedly determined by your individual actions, and not your actions as part of a union or other political institution that works as a bloc to overthrow the status quo. \"Conscious consumption\" arises out of the tradition that gave us Margaret Thatcher's maxim, \"There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first.\" Any attempt to change society by shopping very carefully is destined to fail, but it's worse than that. Because \"shopping very carefully\" never makes systemic change, its practitioners inevitably decide the reason they're not seeing the change they yearn for is that their allies aren't shopping carefully enough. This turns the careful shopper into a cop who polices other people's consumption, demanding that they stop eating some foodstuff or using Twitter or watching HBO Max. Squabbling over whether using a social media network makes you a Nazi generates far more heat than light &#8211; so much heat that it incinerates the solidarity you need to actually fight Nazis. Which is not an argument against boycotts! Boycotts work. If boycotts didn't work, then genocide apologists wouldn't be apoplectic over the BDS movement: https://bdsmovement.net/ But a \"boycott\" isn't the same thing as \"you and your social circle deciding that buying the wrong product makes you a Bad Person and then devoting your energies to scolding your allies for choosing Coke instead of Pepsi.\" Boycotts are downstream of organizing; they are not a substitute for organizing. There is such a thing as society. Now, all that said, I will confess: I sometimes do something that looks a lot like \"shopping very carefully,\" and when I do, I derive enormous satisfaction from it (but I am always careful not to mistake my tiny victories for political action). But I get it, honestly, I do. Sometimes, \"shopping very carefully\" is a way to eke out a tiny, personal victory in the face of overwhelming odds against a wildly overmatched opponent. That feels very good. One example would be patronizing my local repair shop (or fixing my stuff myself). The big structural barriers to repair are things like \"parts pairing\": https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/24/record-scratch/#autoenshittification And manufacturers who abuse trademark law to get CBP to seize refurbished parts at the border: https://www.shacknews.com/article/108049/apple-repair-critic-louis-rossmann-takes-on-us-customs-counterfeit-battery-seizure The repair problem isn't that your neighbors are \"sheeple\" who've had their minds warped by a \"throwaway society.\" The problem is that technical and legal countermeasures have made repair so hard and unprofitable that getting your stuff fixed is more expensive and time-consuming than it needs to be. That said: I love going to my local repair shop. I love fixing things on my own. It's great. It makes me feel great. I think you should do it because it may make you feel great, too, and it'd be nice for you to support your local fix-it place, but let's not pretend that we'll change society that way. Here's another example: for the past couple years, I've been navigating a (thankfully very treatable) cancer diagnosis. The fact that my cancer is very treatable doesn't mean it's easily treated. America's shitty, for-profit healthcare system is terrible at the best of times, and nearly unnavigable when coping with a complex condition that crosses a lot of disciplinary lines and requires access to specialized, expensive equipment. I'm asymptomatic, so the hardest part of having cancer &#8211; so far &#8211; is fighting the Kaiser bureaucracy to make sure my treatment goes off as planned: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/05/carcinoma-angels/#squeaky-nail The fact that the different Kaiser departments drop so many balls when handing off care between them means that I have to juggle those balls for them. I make extensive use of organizational tactics like \"suspense files,\" which are a kind of inverted to-do list, in that they let you manage other people's to-do lists, rather than your own: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/26/one-weird-trick/#todo (In case you're wondering, the best part of having cancer is that Kaiser comps 100% of your parking! Free cancer parking!) Now, I also make sure to note each of Kaiser's failures and I raise grievances and California health ombudsman complaints for each one &#8211; not because I'm angry and want an apology, but because I'm a well-organized, native English-speaking cancer patient with no symptoms, which means that I can do the advocacy that other people can't, and help them (I also track these complaints with suspense files, calendar entries, etc, to make sure that they're followed through). Partly, I'm able to do this because I'm very organized. I'm not organized because I worship at the cult of \"personal productivity\"; I'm definitely Jenny Odell-pilled on that score: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/04/09/how-to-do-nothing-jenny-odells-case-for-resisting-the-attention-economy/ I'm organized because I pursue The Way of Jim Munroe's \"Time Management for Anarchists\" (\"once I learned how to make my own structure, I was able to kick my expensive boss habit and work on my own\"): https://jimmunroe.net/comics/pamphlets/time_management_for_anarchists/time_management_for_anarchists.html Having invested a lot of energy into being organized, I now get massive discounts on dealing with other people's shit. Remember: giant corporations and other remorseless bureaucracies throw up roadblocks on the assumption that you will be a \"rational economic actor.\" The airline assumes that if it costs you 15 hours to collect on the $50 voucher you're entitled to, you will just let them steal $50 from you. But once you get organized enough, you can cut that 15-hour investment down to a 15-minute one, and I will absolutely trade 15 minutes of dealing with an airline's bullshit for $50 of that airline's money. (Why yes, Air Canada did fuck me over on Jan 3 and get me home at 5AM the next day, instead of 730PM the night before; and yes, they did deny my compensation claim; and yes, I have filed an appeal with the Canada Transport Agency; why do you ask?) One of my favorite podcasts is \"An Arm and a Leg,\" which divides itself between deep dive structural analyses into how corrupt and ghastly American medical billing is, and enumerations of sweet hacks that ninja bill-fighters have come up with to slice through the billing labyrinth your insurer and hospital trap you in and cut straight to the bullseye: https://armandalegshow.com/ For example, the latest episode tells the story of Jared Walker, who figured out that hospitals were stealing billions of dollars every year from the poorest people in America, who were all entitled to have their medical bill canceled. He founded Dollarfor, a nonprofit that helps patients get their medical debt canceled: https://armandalegshow.com/episode/our-favorite-project-of-2025-levels-up-and-you-can-help/ Dollarfor now has an automated tool that guides you through a survey and then generates and files the completed, hospital-specific paperwork needed to get your medical debt canceled (they've made versions of this for every hospital in America!): https://dollarfor.org/ (If you're a health worker, here's a printable guide with QR codes that you can clip to your lanyard and show to patients while you deliver care): https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cfwK66A_mfBBBqn35_Lp7930uoY-73f/view Now, the real problem here isn't that hospitals steal billions from charity cases: it's that America has a garbage for-profit healthcare system that kills and bankrupts people at scale. Dollarfor is amazing, but it's not going to fix that problem. I don't know Walker, but I bet if you asked him, he'd agree with this, and say something like, \"Yes, and I'm helping people not have their lives destroyed by this garbage system, which is good unto itself; and also, it might give them the free time and wherewithal to participate in movements to overthrow the garbage system.\" I really dote on the fact that Dollarfor has literally built a different version of their tool for every single hospital in the country. It's a perfect example of how turning yourself into a highly organized adversary can overcome the time-based economics our enemies rely on to keep their garbage systems intact. Whenever I think of this stuff, I flash on two pop-culture references that made a deep impression on me. The first comes from 1985's Real Genius, Val Kilmer's best ever movie (fight me!). Real Genius is set at a fictionalized version of Caltech in which young prodigies slowly discover that their scumbag prof has tricked them into working on a weapons contract for the DoD. This being fictional-Caltech, there are all these scenes in which very smart people do weird and amazing things. At one point, we learn that there's a former child prodigy living in the basement under the dorms, a guy named Lazlo Hollyfeld who became a hermit after discovering that he, too, had been duped into working on a baby-killer project. We get these tantalizing glimpses of Lazlo in his subterranean redoubt, where he has built some kind of giant Rube Goldberg machine that is engaged in a mysterious mechanical process that involves manipulating cards of some sort. At the film's denouement (spoiler alert for a 40 year old movie), we discover what he was doing: Lazlo: These are entries into the Frito-Lay Sweepstakes. \"No purchase necessary, enter as often as you want\" &#8211; so I am. Chris: That's great! How many times? Lazlo: Well, this batch makes it one million six hundred and fifty thousand. I should win thirty-two point six percent of the prizes, including the car. Chris: That kind of takes the fun out of it, doesn't it? Lazlo: They set up the rules, and lately I've come to realize that I have certain materialistic needs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6kBfBXZBdc Then there's a scene from the otherwise tepid (fight me!) Batman Returns (1992) in which we encounter the Penguin in his subterranean redoubt, brandishing pages full of kompromat that have been laboriously taped together: The Penguin: What about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in Gotham City? Maximillian 'Max' Shreck: If there were such documents &#8211; and that's not an admission &#8211; I would have seen to it they were shredded. The Penguin: Ah, good idea! [pulls out a sheaf of documents] The Penguin: A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103776/quotes/ Both Lazlo and the Penguin are defeating the time-based security assumptions of their adversaries. Frito Lay treats filling in 1.65m sweepstakes entries as the same thing as filling in infinity entries; Max Schrek treats the time needed to piece together shredded paper as infinite. Rounding a very large number up to infinity isn't entirely irrational, but once you get organized enough, you just might be able to find the time &#8211; or a system &#8211; to bring that very big number down to an entirely tractable value. Yes, this is a species of \"careful shopping\" but my point isn't to say that shopping carefully is useless &#8211; rather, that it's a drastic error to mistake this useful (and surprisingly satisfying) tactic for a strategy that will truly alter the system.
