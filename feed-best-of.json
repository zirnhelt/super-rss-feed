Musk said the company is returning to the project &quot;now that the AI5 chip design is in good shape.&quot;</p>\n<p>The purpose of the Dojo project is to process video recordings and other data from Tesla vehicles and use that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-autonomous-driving-091123615.html\"><ins>to train</ins></a> the &quot;neural net&quot; behind the company's Full Self-Driving software. Last year, however, Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1953660184351707210\"><ins>posted on X</ins></a> that &quot;It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs. The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The AI chips Musk is referring to are ones <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-02-tesla-is-quietly-making-its-own-ai-chip-for-self-driving-cars.html\"><ins>developed for running FSD</ins></a> onboard Tesla vehicles and are not optimized for training.
