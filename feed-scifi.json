Like <em>Groundhog Day</em>, he's been through this countless times before, and he immediately starts recounting otherwise unknowable details to convince the diner patrons. Like <em>12 Monkeys</em>, he's from the future —&nbsp;the timely twist in <em>Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die</em> is that, rather than a world-ending virus, he needs help preventing a humanity-ending AI from being born.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Good Luck </em>is more of a primal scream than a thoughtful articulation about where everything went wrong. There's a bit of &quot;old man yells at cloud&quot; energy here (director Gore Verbinski is 61, and screenwriter Matthew Robinson is 47), but it fits the film's satirical tone. Looking around at the world today, who doesn't wish they could warn their past selves about the tech industry and the new ruling class it helped breed.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Rockwell's character eventually wrangles a ragtag crew of future saviors: Mark and Janet (Michael Pena and Zazie Beetz), a married couple of high school teachers; Susan (Juno Temple), a distraught mother; and Ingrid (Haley Lu Richardson), a sad woman wearing a princess dress. There's also Asim Chaudhry's Scott, who mostly serves as comic relief, but doesn't get any real backstory like the others.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Good Luck</em> wastes no time fleshing out its present near-dystopia in episodic chapters. It turns out Mark and Janet are also on the run from smartphone-obsessed high schoolers, who spend their days scrolling through endless TikTok-like feeds. Susan is forced to confront a horrific situation around her son (I won't get into specifics here, but it's a distinctly American phenomenon). And Ingrid is literally allergic to Wi-Fi and smart devices, which makes it hard to fit into the modern world.&nbsp;</p><p>Each of these scenarios play out like mini <em>Black Mirror</em> episodes<em>. </em>Everything is heightened to the absurd, and all the problems can be traced back to unchecked technological encroachment and capitalism. Nothing subtle there. The glimpses of an apocalyptic future are even less so — all we see are destroyed cities, people trapped in VR headsets (which place them in an AI-generated reality) and robots hunting down anti-AI humans.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Sam Rockwell in Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/g_100nit_r709_1.388.1.jpg\" style=\"height: 1367px; width: 2500px;\" /><figcaption>Sam Rockwell in Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Briarcliff Entertainment</div></figure><p><em>Good Luck</em> is at its best when it's simply having fun. As Rockwell and crew make their way to their final destination — a child who is about to invent true AI — they encounter pig-faced assassins, Stepford-esque parents and an adorably horrific kaiju. Even when faced with half-baked scripts, Verbinski always manages to impress visually (think back to the creepiness of <em>The</em> <em>Ring</em>, or the wildly entertaining set pieces in <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>). That's as true as ever here, where the final scene evokes the hyper-tech chaos of <em>Akira</em>.</p><p>As much as <em>Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die</em>, evokes classic sci-fi, it still can’t hold a candle to the sheer terror of seeing AI unleash a nuclear bomb in <em>Terminator 2</em>. And despite its zanines, it doesn’t reach the madcap heights of Gilliam’s <em>Brazil </em>or <em>12 Monkeys</em>. But if you’re sick of having AI products shoved down your throat, and you think the notion of “true AI” is a farce, it’s a fun way to channel your rage.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/good-luck-have-fun-dont-die-rails-against-ai-in-style-154437854.html?src=rss",

The games don't have a story-driven protagonist, so Momoa is likely to play a currently unnamed soldier.</p>\n<p>We also have a release date for the <em>Helldivers</em> film. It comes out on November 10, 2027. That's a while from now, but at least it gives fans something to look forward to. The movie is <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/fast--furious-director-justin-lin-is-making-the-helldivers-movie-173429140.html\"><ins>being directed by Justin Lin</ins></a>, who is best known for helming several entries in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise.

He wrote both It and <em>It Chapter Two</em>, in addition to the horror film <em>Annabelle</em> and its follow-ups.

The games are set in a hyper-patriotic dystopia called Super Earth. <em>Helldivers 2</em> dropped back in 2024, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-on-august-26-172937757.html\"><ins>though was recently released for Xbox</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>Sony hasn't announced any other actors who will be joining Momoa.
