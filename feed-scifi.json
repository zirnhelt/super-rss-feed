The studio behind <em>Until Dawn </em>and <em>The Quarry </em>revealed the news with the help of a fresh trailer for the sci-fi survival horror game.</p><p>The story focuses on the crew of a spaceship that has crash landed onto another world. The survivors have to contend with an alien lifeform that's hunting them and can mimic its prey (no prizes for guessing that Supermassive took inspiration from <em>The Thing </em>here). If these astronauts want to stay alive, though, they'll put the lives of everyone on a dying Earth at risk.</p><p>As with Supermassive's previous games, <em>Directive 8020</em> is largely driven by the narrative choices players make at key moments, such as whether to save a crewmate and put the character you're currently controlling at risk, or to abandon them. You might also have to pick between two seemingly identical versions of the same person and let one of them back into the crew. The game has segments in which you'll have to fight or stealthily avoid enemies as well.</p><p>This time around, Supermassive is introducing a feature called Turning Points, through which you can go back to previous decisions and opt for another path (perhaps to see different endings more easily, keep certain characters alive or make sure you get all the achievements or trophies). A permadeath mode does away with that option for a more traditional survival horror experience.&nbsp;</p><p>You can go it alone or get some friends to join you for five-player local co-op action — the studio's games have long been good fodder for pass-the-controller couch co-op. Supermassive will add online multiplayer support down the line.</p><p>The developer originally planned to release <em>Directive 8020 </em>in October 2025. However, Supermassive announced last July that it was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/supermassive-games-is-delaying-directive-8020-and-laying-off-staff-165815343.html\" target=\"_blank\">delaying the game</a> amid its latest round of layoffs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/directive-8020-brings-sci-fi-survival-horror-to-ps5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc-on-may-12-163358560.html?src=rss",
