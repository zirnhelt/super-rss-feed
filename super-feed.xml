Its two-year plans are up to 78 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $101 for two years, plus four additional free months. That works out to $3.59 per month during the promotional period.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html"&gt;best premium VPN&lt;/a&gt;. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span id="end-legacy-contents"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Basic plan is $78 right now for 28 months, down from $363, and the Pro plan is $168, down from $560. That's 78 percent and 70 percent off, respectively. All plans carry a 30-day money-back guarantee for new users, so you can try it without committing long term if you’re on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-up-to-78-percent-off-expressvpn-two-year-plans-180602525.html?src=rss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Engadget | Score: 30&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 20:05:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Here's what Wall Street bank CEOs are saying about head count in the age of AI</title><link>https://www.businessinsider.com/jpmorgan-citi-goldman-bofa-wells-how-ai-impact-headcounts-2026</link><description>From JPMorgan to Citi, here's what industry leaders at are saying about how AI may impact jobs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Business Insider | Score: 30&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 10:51:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>After a contractor quoted them $63,000, a woman and her husband built her mom a tiny home for half the cost</title><link>https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-and-husband-built-mom-tiny-home-on-their-property-2026-1</link><description>When Yeli Heidecker and her husband discovered it would cost at least $63,000 to have a tiny home built for her mom, they decided to do it themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Business Insider | Score: 30&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 13:02:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Musk's AI sued after generating explicit images of his co-parent</title><link>https://boingboing.net/2026/01/16/musks-ai-sued-after-generating-explicit-images-of-his-co-parent.html</link><description>&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2026/01/16/musks-ai-sued-after-generating-explicit-images-of-his-co-parent.html" rel="nofollow" title="Musk&amp;#039;s AI sued after generating explicit images of his co-parent"&gt;&lt;img alt="Elon Musk (screengrab)" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" height="1080" src="https://i0.wp.com/boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/It-is-what-it-is.jpg?fit=2016%2C1080&amp;amp;quality=60&amp;amp;ssl=1" style="display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;" width="2016" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has long mocked safety concerns over AI.

In return, China will be reducing tariffs on Canadian canola seeds from 84 percent to about 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move is a break from the United States, which maintains a 100 percent tariff on EVs from China, effectively banning them in the country. Mexico currently tariffs the vehicles at 50 percent after&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, which Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &amp;quot;preliminary,&amp;quot; Canada will allow up to 49,000 Chinese EVs into the country, with that number rising to 70,000 after five years. Until now the three major North American trading partners had been aligned in trying to protect their domestic electric vehicle manufacturing.

It was unexpected and delightful to see Lego come up with a way to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/lego-is-trying-to-make-tech-invisible-with-smart-play-130000979.html" target="_blank"&gt;modernize its bricks&lt;/a&gt; without the need for apps, screens or AI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I was a little surprised this week when the Lego Education group &lt;a class="link rapid-with-clickid" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=70bceed8-b1ae-4af0-9fde-faa9258e1bc8&amp;amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=55b2488e-c460-4d49-99ec-60dfa20ede3f&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;merchantName=LEGO&amp;amp;linkText=announced&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZWdvLmNvbS9lbi11cy9hYm91dHVzL25ld3MvMjAyNi9qYW51YXJ5L2xlZ28tZWR1Y2F0aW9uLWNzLWFpIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI1NWIyNDg4ZS1jNDYwLTRkNDktOTllYy02MGRmYTIwZWRlM2YiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ28uY29tL2VuLXVzL2Fib3V0dXMvbmV3cy8yMDI2L2phbnVhcnkvbGVnby1lZHVjYXRpb24tY3MtYWkifQ&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAYdEE5V4t61RjVVhKdLrAzFg9QCmcTCAZ8UncrC-OrdJ&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2026%2Fjanuary%2Flego-education-cs-ai" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest initiative is the Computer Science and AI Learning Solution. After all, generative AI feels like the antithesis of Lego’s creative values. But Andrew Silwinski, Lego Education’s head of product experience, was quick to defend Lego’s approach, noting that being fluent in the tools behind AI is not about generating sloppy images or music and more about expanding what it means by teaching computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think most people should probably know that we started working on this before ChatGPT [got big],” Silwinski told Engadget earlier this week. “Some of the ideas that underline AI are really powerful foundational ideas, regardless of the current frontier model that's out this week. Helping children understand probability and statistics, data quality, algorithmic bias, sensors, machine perception. These are really foundational core ideas that go back to the 1970s.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, Lego Education designed courses for grades K-2, 3-5 and 6-8 that incorporate Lego bricks, additional hardware and lessons tailored to introducing the fundamentals of AI as an extension of existing computer science education. The kits are designed for four students to work together, with teacher oversight. Much of this all comes from learnings Lego found &lt;a class="link" href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/resources/cs-ai-education-insights/#global-report" target="_blank"&gt;in a study it commissioned&lt;/a&gt; showing that teachers often find they don’t have the right resources to teach these subjects. The study showed that half of teachers globally say “current resources leave students bored” while nearly half say “computer science isn’t relatable and doesn’t connect to students’ interests or day to day.” Given kids’ familiarity with Lego and the multiple decades of experience Lego Education has in putting courses like this together, it seems like a logical step to push in this direction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Lego’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://education.lego.com/en-us/lego-education-computer-science-and-ai/" target="_blank"&gt;materials about the new courses&lt;/a&gt;, AI is far from the only subject covered. Coding, looping code, triggering events and sequences, if/then conditionals and more are all on display through the combination of Lego-built models and other hardware to motorize it. It feels more like a computer science course that also introduces concepts of AI rather than something with an end goal of having kids build a chatbot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, Lego set up a number of “red lines” in terms of how it would introduce AI. “No data can ever go across the internet to us or any other third party,” Silwinski said. “And that's a really hard bar if you know anything about AI.” So instead of going to the cloud, everything had to be able to do local inference on, as Silwinski said, “the 10-year-old Chromebooks you’ll see in classrooms.” He added that “kids can train their own machine learning models, and all of that is happening locally in the classroom, and none of that data ever leaves the student's device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lego also says that its lessons never anthropomorphize AI, one of the things that is so common in consumer-facing AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini and many more. “One of the things we're seeing a lot of with generative AI tools is children have a tendency to see them as somehow human or almost magical. A lot of it's because of the conversational interface, it abstracts all the mechanics away from the child.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lego also recognized that it had to build a course that’ll work regardless of a teacher’s fluency in such subjects. So a big part of developing the course was making sure that teachers had the tools they needed to be on top of whatever lessons they’re working on. “When we design and we test the products, we're not the ones testing in the classroom,” Silwinski said. “We give it to a teacher and we provide all of the lesson materials, all of the training, all of the notes, all the presentation materials, everything that they need to be able to teach the lesson.” Lego also took into account the fact that some schools might introduce its students to these things starting in Kindergarten, whereas others might skip to the grade 3-5 or 6-8 sets. To alleviate any bumps in the courses for students or teachers, Lego Education works with school districts and individual schools to make sure there’s an on-ramp for those starting from different places in their fluency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the idea of “teaching AI” seemed out of character for Lego initially, the approach it’s taking here actually reminds me a bit of Smart Play. With Smart Play, the technology is essentially invisible — kids can just open up a set, start building, and get all the benefits of the new system without having to hook up to an app or a screen. In the same vein, Silwinski said that a lot of the work you can do with the Computer Science and AI kit doesn’t need a screen, particularly the lessons designed for younger kids. And the sets themselves have a mode that acts similar to a mesh, where you connect numerous motors and sensors together to build “incredibly complex interactions and behaviors” without even needing a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For educators interested in checking out this latest course, Lego has single kits up for pre-order starting at $339.95; they’ll start shipping in April. That’s the pricing for the K-2 sets, the 3-5 and 6-8 sets are $429.95 and $529.95, respectively. A single kit covers four students. Lego is also selling bundles with six kits, and school districts can also request a quote for bigger orders.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/legos-latest-educational-kit-seeks-to-teach-ai-as-part-of-computer-science-not-to-build-a-chatbot-184636741.html?src=rss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Engadget | Score: 65&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:46:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Rackspace customers grapple with “devastating” email hosting price hike</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2026/01/rackspace-raises-email-hosting-prices-by-as-much-as-706-percent/</link><description>Reseller says Rackspace plans to charge it 706 percent more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Ars Technica – Technology Lab | Score: 65&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 23:15:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Mandiant releases rainbow table that cracks weak admin password in 12 hours</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/01/mandiant-releases-rainbow-table-that-cracks-weak-admin-password-in-12-hours/</link><description>Windows laggards still using the vulnerable hashing function: Your days are numbered.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Ars Technica – Technology Lab | Score: 70&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:05:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Affordability, respite shortfall, making life difficult for B.C. seniors: advocate</title><link>https://wltribune.com/2026/01/17/affordability-respite-shortfall-making-life-difficult-for-b-c-seniors-advocate/</link><description>Affordability, respite shortfall, making life difficult for B.C. seniors: advocate&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Williams Lake Tribune | Score: 75&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Why There’s No Single Best Way To Store Information</title><link>https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-theres-no-single-best-way-to-store-information-20260116/</link><description>The math of data structures helps us understand how different storage systems come with different trade-offs between resources such as time and memory.            &lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-theres-no-single-best-way-to-store-information-20260116/" target="_blank"&gt;Why There’s No Single Best Way To Store Information&lt;/a&gt; first appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org" target="_blank"&gt;Quanta Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Quanta Magazine | Score: 75&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:10:10 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>there's no place like 127.0.0.1</title><link>https://www.metafilter.com/211864/theres-no-place-like-127001</link><description>&lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/tech/europeans-encourage-ditch-big-tech-and-go-local/"&gt;Europeans quietly shift away from US tech services, share lists of local alternatives&lt;/a&gt; A new wave of online lists is mapping out European alternatives to everyday apps and platforms, encouraging users to switch from US tech platforms and instead support local innovation, reclaiming control of their digital lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curated "tech swap" lists are trending across Europe.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year China installed more than half of all wind and solar added globally. In May alone, it added enough renewable energy to power Poland, installing solar panels at a rate of roughly 100 every second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The massive buildout is happening across the country, from crowded eastern cities increasingly topped by rooftop solar panels to remote western deserts where colossal wind farms sprawl across the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anthropic launched Cowork as an exclusive feature for its &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html" target="_blank"&gt;Max subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, who pay a minimum of $100 per month for more uses of Claude's expensive reasoning models and early access to experimental features. Now Claude Cowork is available at a cheaper price, though Anthropic notes &amp;quot;Pro users may hit their usage limits earlier&amp;quot; than Max users do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other AI agents, the novelty of Claude Cowork is its ability to work on its own. If you have the macOS Claude app and a Pro subscription, you can prompt Claude Cowork to work on tasks on your local computer, like creating documents based on files you have saved or organizing your folders. The feature is an evolution of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-new-claude-model-can-think-both-fast-and-slow-203307140.html" target="_blank"&gt;Claude Code&lt;/a&gt;, Anthropic's AI coding agent, and can similarly use connectors and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html" target="_blank"&gt;Claude Chrome plugin&lt;/a&gt; to work with other apps and the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of this expanded rollout, Anthropic has included a few fixes inspired by early user feedback. You'll now be able to rename sessions with Claude Cowork (&amp;quot;Tasks&amp;quot; in the parlance of the Claude app) and the company says the AI assistant will offer better file format previews, more reliable use of connectors to other apps and confirmation messages before it deletes files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coding agents top the list of applications of AI that have gained real traction in the last year, so Anthropic applying what it learned with Claude Code to a more general collection of computer tasks makes sense. Claude Cowork is still limited to macOS and Anthropic's paid subscribers, but assuming the AI agent continues to be popular, it wouldn't be surprising if the company brought it to other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-opens-up-its-claude-cowork-feature-to-anyone-with-a-20-subscription-194000021.html?src=rss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Engadget | Score: 75&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 19:40:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>AGI?

Starting today, Anthropic is giving regular people a way to take advantage of those capabilities, with the release of a new preview feature called &lt;a class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/blog/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRfApB7i3w$" target="_blank"&gt;Claude Cowork&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is billing Cowork as &amp;quot;a simpler way for anyone — not just developers — to work with Claude.&amp;quot; After you give the system access to a folder on your computer, it can read, edit or create new files in that folder on your behalf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic gives a few different example use cases for Cowork. For instance, you could ask Claude to organize your downloads folder, telling it to rename the files contained within to something that's easier to parse at a glance. Another example:  you could use Claude to turn screenshots of receipts and invoices into a spreadsheet for tracking expenses. Cowork can also navigate websites — provided you install &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/claudes-chrome-plugin-is-now-available-to-all-paid-users-221024295.html" target="_blank"&gt;Claude’s Chrome plugin&lt;/a&gt; — and make can use Anthropic's &lt;a class="link" href="https://claude.com/connectors" target="_blank"&gt;Connectors framework&lt;/a&gt; to access third-party apps like Canva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cowork is designed to make using Claude for new work as simple as possible. You don’t need to keep manually providing context or converting Claude’s outputs into the right format,&amp;quot; the company said. &amp;quot;Nor do you have to wait for Claude to finish before offering further ideas or feedback: you can queue up tasks and let Claude work through them in parallel.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the idea of granting Claude access to your computer sounds ill-advised, Anthropic says Claude &amp;quot;can’t read or edit anything you don’t give it explicit access to.&amp;quot; However, the company &lt;a class="link" href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!H4Kg5gp_7yMadnW8YNEBXhHxFfRXLlqiUWXMTjA_hFLzMfx0bTA_OeGZT1TyI4CviOt0JcJuN-CbfRe6TM4kUQ$" target="_blank"&gt;does note&lt;/a&gt; the system can &amp;quot;take potentially destructive actions,&amp;quot; such as deleting a file that is important to you or misinterpreting your instructions. For that reason, Anthropic suggests it's best to give &amp;quot;very clear&amp;quot; guidance to Claude.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic isn’t the first to offer a computer agent. Microsoft, for example, has been pushing Copilot hard for nearly three years, despite &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/it-seems-like-most-windows-users-dont-care-for-copilot-195500516.html" target="_blank"&gt;seemingly limited adoption&lt;/a&gt;. For Anthropic, the challenge will be convincing people these tools are useful where others have failed. The fact Claude Code has been universally loved by programmers may make that task easier.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthropic briefly made Cowork preview only available to users of its pricey &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-max-plan-offers-nearly-unlimited-claude-usage-for-200-per-month-170032710.html" target="_blank"&gt;Claude Max&lt;/a&gt; subscription. That changed on Friday when the company expanded access to include customers of its $20 per month Pro plan.  If you want to try Cowork for yourself, you'll need a Mac with the Claude macOS app installed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 01/16/26 2:30PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;: Updated to reflect Claude Cowork is now also available to Claude Pro customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-launches-claude-cowork-a-version-of-its-coding-ai-for-regular-people-193000849.html?src=rss&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Engadget | Score: 80&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 19:32:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>TSMC says AI demand is “endless” after record Q4 earnings</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/tsmc-says-ai-demand-is-endless-after-record-q4-earnings/</link><description>Amid fears of bubble, world's top chipmaker TSMC says customers just keep asking for more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Ars Technica – Technology Lab | Score: 85&lt;/em&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:55:08 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
