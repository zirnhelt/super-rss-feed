Disney claimed that Seedance 2.0 uses &quot;a pirated library of Disney's copyrighted characters from Star Wars, Marvel, and other Disney franchises, as if Disney's coveted intellectual property were free public domain clip art.&quot; Disney included example videos that included its copyrighted characters, such as Spider-Man and Darth Vader.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Paramount Skydance has also reportedly issued a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance to stop Seedance 2.0 from using its materials, according to the<em> BBC</em>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/bytedance-promises-to-tighten-up-its-new-ai-video-generator-after-viral-cruise-vs-pitt-clip-112941384.html?src=rss",
