The Geely-owned Swedish company sold a record 61,000 EVs in 2025, but hopes that the new models will help it take an even bigger bite out of the market. &quot;We want to get more volume out of a bigger cake,&quot; CEO Michael Lohscheller said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Polestar currently offers two models in the US, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/polestar-3-first-drive-the-long-awaited-suv-is-finally-here-and-its-good-154552543.html\">Polestar 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-4-electric-suv-arrives-with-544-hp-and-no-rear-window-073505710.html\">Polestar 4</a>, both SUVs. However, the new Polestar 4 will come in two variants, one a traditional SUV as before and the other a four-door wagon-type version that combines &quot;the space of an estate and the versatility of an SUV,&quot; Loscheller said. &quot;It's all the good things from the current car, but it's a bit more practical.&quot; This new model is due later this year and will be built in Busan, South Korea in order to avoid US tariffs on cars built in China.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The automaker is also planning to release a new version of the Polestar 2 targeted at young buyers, though that one is unlikely to come to the US. It will be slightly longer for more passenger space and be produced in China like the current model 2.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Polestar 5, Polestar 4, Polestar 2, Polestar 7\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/767bb730-0cd6-11f1-bb9d-4cb515cb45d6\" style=\"height: 787px; width: 1836px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Polestar</div></figure>\n<p>Finally, the Polestar 7 will be a compact SUV in the same family as Volvo's EX60, set to arrive in Europe to address the fast-growing compact SUV segment. &quot;We are convinced that we can offer customers a progressive performance-driven car for a very attractive price point, built in Europe,&quot; Lohscheller said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new models are designed to help Polestar hit its goal of 60 percent of EV sales worldwide by &quot;targeting the big profit pools of the BEV segment,&quot; Lohscheller stated. Following Polestar's withdrawal from the hyper-competitive Chinese market, Europe accounts for 78 percent of its sales and the US most of the rest — but the company hopes to boost its fortunes in the latter. &quot;People forget that the U.S. is a big EV market, especially on the east and west coasts,&quot; the CEO added. &quot;And it will stay a big market.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/polestar-unveils-a-station-wagon-version-of-the-4-144025505.html?src=rss",

If you’ll recall, a California administrative law judge <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-used-deceptive-language-to-market-autopilot-california-judge-rules-035826786.html\" target=\"_blank\">ruled in December</a> that the automaker misled consumers by using the terms “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving.” The judge recommended the suspension, but the California DMV gave Tesla 60 days to remove any untrue and misleading language in its marketing materials. In its announcement, the DMV said Tesla has taken corrective action and has stopped using Autopilot for marketing. Prior to that, the automaker has already clarified that driver supervision is still needed with Full Self-Driving. </p><p>The judge was ruling on a complaint the DMV made back in 2022, wherein the agency accused Tesla of making and disseminating misleading statements. It argued that starting in May 2021, Tesla used deceptive marketing materials with the labels “Autopilot” and  “Full Self-Driving Capability,” as well as claimed that the “system is designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.” In reality, the vehicles equipped with those features “could not at the time of those advertisements, and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles,” the DMV said. </p><p>A ban in California could have had a huge effect on the company, seeing as the state <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-first-quarter-registrations-california-fell-15-industry-data-shows-2025-04-16/\" target=\"_blank\">accounts</a> for nearly a third of its sales in the country. Tesla also recently announced that it will stop the production of its Model S and X cars to turn its Fremont, California factory where they were being manufactured into a space for the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-is-killing-off-its-model-s-and-x-cars-to-make-robots-010621101.html\" target=\"_blank\">production of its Optimus</a> humanoid robots. Tesla has huge plans for Optimus and intends to start selling the robot to the public by the end of 2027. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-stops-using-autopilot-to-promote-its-evs-in-california-112533060.html?src=rss",
