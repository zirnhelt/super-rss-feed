PRIMARY INTERESTS (High Relevance - Score 70-100):
- AI/tech with rural, community, or local application: AI tools for small towns, precision agriculture, rural broadband/connectivity, digital equity, community technology, civic tech, AI for emergency management, wildfire detection, remote education tech, telehealth, AI applied to resource industries (forestry, ranching, mining), off-grid technology

- Smart home and home automation: HomeKit, HomeBridge, Omada networking, home network infrastructure
- 3D printing: Bambu Lab ecosystem, PLA materials, printer mechanics, slicing software
- Williams Lake and Cariboo local news: Community events, regional development, local politics, Indigenous issues (Williams Lake, Quesnel, 100 Mile House, Horsefly, Lac la Hache — NOT Kamloops, Kelowna, or other non-Cariboo BC cities)

SECONDARY INTERESTS (Medium Relevance - Score 40-69):
- AI/ML infrastructure and insider tech: MLOps, observability, production AI systems, platform engineering, data pipelines — score these 40-60, they are interesting background reading but NOT podcast-worthy unless they connect to rural, community, or practical applications
- Systems thinking and complex systems: Network effects, feedback loops, emergence, interdependencies, resilience
- Meshtastic and LoRa mesh networking: Off-grid communication, mesh protocols, rural connectivity
- Homelab and self-hosting: Infrastructure, privacy-focused tech, home servers, automation

- Sci-fi worldbuilding: Hard science fiction, speculative fiction, world-building systems, narrative construction

CONTEXTUAL INTERESTS (Score Based on Quality - 20-60):
- Cariboo region culture and development: BC rural issues, small-town planning, regional history (Cariboo region only, not broader BC Interior)
- Food preservation and traditional skills: When tied to systems thinking or sustainability
- Off-grid and homestead technology: Solar systems, water management, DIY infrastructure
- Deep technical how-tos: Hands-on guides, configuration walkthroughs, troubleshooting
- Scientific research and discoveries: Breakthrough studies, novel findings with systems implications

SCORING NOTES:
- Local Williams Lake/Cariboo content should score 80+ regardless of topic
- Kamloops-only stories (not relevant to Williams Lake/Cariboo) should NOT get local priority — score on merit of other interests only
- AI/tech articles should score HIGH (70-100) when they connect to rural life, community infrastructure, local government, resource industries, or practical small-town applications
- AI/tech articles should score MEDIUM (40-60) when they are pure insider/industry content (MLOps benchmarks, cloud platform comparisons, enterprise SaaS, Silicon Valley trends) with no rural or community angle
- Content bridging multiple interests (e.g. "solar homestead automation") scores higher
- Prefer deep analysis over breaking news
- Prioritize systems-level thinking over isolated facts
- Technical depth and hands-on utility boost scores

AVOID (Score 0-20):
- Celebrity news, gossip, advice columns, entertainment industry news
- Sports coverage (unless technology/systems angle)
- Arts, music charts, album releases, film festivals, award shows
- Surface-level product reviews without technical depth
- Clickbait and engagement farming
- Pure lifestyle content without systems thinking
- Wire service entertainment/celebrity stories syndicated through local news sources
