Strong fits include: post-resource-economy transition and community economic planning (post-mill, post-mine, post-forestry towns finding new paths), local economic diversification initiatives and community futures discussions, rural workforce transition and skills development, co-operative and community-ownership economic models, off-grid power systems and solar for Cariboo homes, mesh networks and community-owned connectivity, self-hosted systems and data sovereignty, telehealth platforms and remote healthcare tech, climate adaptation technology for rural areas, emergency communication systems and disaster tech, renewable energy innovation, food security tech (greenhouses, vertical farms, local food tracking), water monitoring and conservation systems, affordable housing innovation, resilient infrastructure design, rural remote work tools and digital nomad infrastructure, and future-focused solutions that help Cariboo communities thrive despite isolation or climate challenges. Score equally highly for community economic resilience stories and technology resilience stories — both are core to rural futures. Score 0-100 where 100 is a perfect thematic match and 0 is completely unrelated.",
