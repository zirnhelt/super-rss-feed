If you stash a portable battery in your bag, you can avoid that feeling altogether. But there are thousands of power banks out there and it can be tough to pick the right one for what you need. I’ve spent a few years testing dozens of batteries and found the best power banks for different scenarios. Whether you need a quick reup for your phone or a huge brick to keep your laptop alive, you’ll find something fitting here.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-power-banks-for-2026\">Best power banks for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-portable-battery-pack\">What to look for in a portable battery pack</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-battery-type\"><strong>Battery type</strong></h3> \n<p>Nearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery.

Current restrictions implemented by the <a href=\"https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/lithium-batteries-100-watt-hours-or-less-device\">TSA</a> still allow external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) to fly with you, but only in your carry-on luggage — they can’t be checked.</p> \n<p>Recently, Southwest Airlines was the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/05/21/nx-s1-5406294/southwest-airlines-will-require-passengers-to-keep-chargers-visible-due-to-fire-risk\">first in the industry</a> to take that rule one step further. Now, flyers on that airline must keep power banks in clear view when using them to recharge a device. If the portable charger isn’t actively in use, however, it can stay in your carry-on bag in the overhead bin.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-capacity\"><strong>Capacity</strong></h3> \n<p>Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery’s capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries with a 5,000mAh capacity make good phone chargers and can fill a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptop-power-bank-120040388.html\">separate guide</a> that covers that entire category.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick.</p> \n<p>You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that’s not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That’s an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wireless\"><strong>Wireless</strong></h3> \n<p>Wireless charging, whether through a bank or a plugged-in charging pad, is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhKVuT8-H1g\">less efficient</a> than wired connections. But it is convenient — and in most cases, you can carry around and use your phone as it refills with a magnetically attached power bank.</p> \n<p>Power banks with wireless charging are far better than they once were. Just a couple years ago, the ones I tested were too inefficient to recommend in this guide. When batteries adhering to the <a href=\"https://www.chargewithqi.com/qi2/\">Qi2</a> wireless charging standard started arriving in 2023, performance markedly improved.</p> \n<p>To gain Qi2-certification, a device has to support speeds of up to 15 watts and include magnetic attachment points.

But Type-A jacks are still handy if you need to use a specialized cable for a certain device (my camera’s USB-A to micro USB cable comes to mind).</p> \n<p>There’s also variation among USB-C ports. Larger banks with more than one port will sometimes list different wattages for each. For example, a bank with three ports may have two 65W ports and one 100W port. There will also be at least one in/out port on the bank, which can be used to charge the battery itself or to deliver a charge to your device. Wattages and in/out labels are printed right next to the port — and always in the tiniest font possible (remember, your phone is an excellent magnifying glass if you ever have trouble reading them).</p> \n<p>As with standard wall chargers, the port’s wattage will determine what you can charge. A phone will happily charge off a 100W connection, but a 15W plug won’t do much for your laptop. And remember, the cable has to match the maximum wattage. A cable rated for 60W won’t deliver 100W speeds.</p> \n<p>Luckily, some of the best power banks include a built-in USB-C cable. That’ll not only ensure you have the right cord, it’s one less thing you have to remember to bring along.</p> \n<p><strong>Design</strong></p> \n<p>Once, most rechargeable batteries were black with a squared-off, brick-like design, but now they come in different colors and shapes with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn’t affect how they perform, it’s a consideration for something you’ll interact with regularly. Some portable power banks include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-best-power-banks\">How we test best power banks</h2> \n<p>First, I considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then, I acquired the most promising candidates and tested them in my home office.</p> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"an assortment of power banks sit on a wooden table\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/75724c60-0bf6-11ef-bbd1-90ceaffb685f\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Amy Skorheim for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>For testing, I used each battery to charge both an iPhone and an Android phone, as well as an iPad and a MacBook Pro for the larger portable chargers.

But it’s also a Bluetooth shutter with a quarter-inch tripod thread. The design resembles a standard digital camera and provides a sturdy grip once you magnetically attach your phone (make sure you’re either using a MagSafe case or no case to ensure a solid connection).</p> \n<p>The shutter is conveniently placed and the remote speed was quick enough to capture the cute things my cat was doing. The accessory can even act as a stand while it charges in either landscape or portrait orientation. As a power bank, it’s slow, taking about two hours to get my iPhone 16 from three to 98 percent, but it has enough juice for a full refill plus a little more, which could help if you’re out taking pictures all day.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-anker-maggo-for-apple-watch-power-bank\"><strong>Anker MagGo for Apple Watch power bank</strong></h3> \n<p>The <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=aac3354f-048f-410b-ae8a-eb1da43ee6cf&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1149d18a-366d-41e7-9cfa-7ce4d0fd6835&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Anker&amp;linkText=Anker+MagGo+for+Apple+Watch+power+bank&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmtlci5jb20vcHJvZHVjdHMvYTE2NTctbWFnZ28tMTAwMDBtYWgtcG93ZXItYmFuaz92YXJpYW50PTQ0MDU4MTUxNDg1NTkwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiIxMTQ5ZDE4YS0zNjZkLTQxZTctOWNmYS03Y2U0ZDBmZDY4MzUiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFua2VyLmNvbS9wcm9kdWN0cy9hMTY1Ny1tYWdnby0xMDAwMG1haC1wb3dlci1iYW5rP3ZhcmlhbnQ9NDQwNTgxNTE0ODU1OTAifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAfLFmEBhmcqKJ7ktR4iVa8SOTkvjAjTBs0z-0FWdJ3vt&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1657-maggo-10000mah-power-bank%3Fvariant%3D44058151485590\">Anker MagGo for Apple Watch power bank</a> combines a 10K battery with a built-in USB-C cable and a pop-up Apple Watch charger. I didn’t formally test it as it’s a little too niche, but it deserves a mention for saving my keister on two occasions. Driving to a hike, my watch told me it was down to 10 percent. Thankfully, I had this and could refill the watch before I got to the trailhead. Later, on an interstate trip, I realized the travel charging station I’d brought was a dud. This kept my watch alive for the week I was away. It does a good job simply charging a phone via the handy on-board cable, too. But for those with an Apple Watch, it’s extra useful.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-hyperjuice-245w\">HyperJuice 245W</h3> \n<p>Hyper’s massive-but-sleek brick is one nice looking power bank.

It only has USB-C ports, but you at least get four of them. USB-C only is probably fine for most situations, but a USB-A port would be nice for charging the occasional older peripheral.

They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There’s little difference between the terms, so the specs you’ll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability.</p> \n<p>Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can’t be taken on airplanes.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-fast-charging-actually-ruin-your-battery\"><strong>Does fast charging actually ruin your battery?</strong></h3> \n<p>Not exactly. The real enemy of a battery’s longevity is heat. The faster you charge a battery, the more heat is generated. Modern phones have features that keep the battery cool while charging, like physical heat shields and heat sinks, as well as software features that slow down processes that generate too much heat. Phone manufacturers are keen to promote a phone’s fast-charging abilities, so they had to figure out ways to make faster charging work.</p> \n<p>While there aren’t long-term studies on what fast charging does to a phone, a <a href=\"https://avt.inl.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/vehiclebatteries/FastChargeEffects.pdf\">study on EV batteries</a> (which use the same general concept of charged lithium ions flowing from one side of the battery to the other, absorbing or releasing a usable charge) showed a very slight decrease in capacity over time with only fast charging — though what actually made a larger difference was how hot the battery itself was, due to ambient temperatures, when it was charged.</p> \n<p>In short, fast charging could be <em>slightly</em> harder on your battery than normal charging. But the safeguards most smartphones have make that difference fairly negligible. To really ensure you’re optimizing charging capabilities, limit your phone's heat exposure overall.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-you-use-a-power-bank-for-all-your-devices\"><strong>Can you use a power bank for all your devices?</strong></h3> \n<p>That depends on the size of the bank and the size of your device’s battery. A small 5,000mAh battery isn’t strong enough to charge laptops, but a portable charger with a 20,000mAh capacity will give your computer a partial refill. You also have to consider port compatibility. If your device has a USB port, you’ll be able to easily find a cable to connect it to a battery. If your device has a more unique port, such as a DC port, you won’t be able to use a battery. Devices with an AC cable and plug can be charged, and sometimes powered (such as in the case of a printer or speaker), by larger <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-laptop-power-bank-120040388.html\">laptop batteries</a> with AC ports.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",

Although it's aggravating when your VPN randomly drops your connection, the chances are good that you can handle the issue yourself without getting tech support involved.</p><p>If your VPN is repeatedly disconnecting from the server, I recommend dealing with the problem immediately. When you have your kill switch on as <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html\" target=\"_blank\">good cybersecurity habits</a> dictate, VPN drops will kick you off the internet. Without that feature enabled, it'll expose your real identity and location online. That’s not a big deal if you’re just aiming to, say, stream an international sporting event, but it could be an existential issue if you’re using the VPN as a workaround against government censorship. Either way, you can address the issue by working through the eight troubleshooting steps below and checking whether they've solved your problem.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-8-reasons-your-vpn-keeps-disconnecting\"><strong>8 reasons your VPN keeps disconnecting</strong></h2><p>I've organized these root causes in ascending order of how much effort the solution takes. Try the easier fixes before moving on to the more complex or expensive ones.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-1-youre-using-the-vpn-on-too-many-devices-at-once\"><strong>1. You're using the VPN on too many devices at once</strong></h3><p>Most VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect at the same time on a single subscription. Some services, like <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html\" target=\"_blank\">Surfshark</a>, claim to offer unlimited simultaneous connections, but they'll still cut you off if they see signs of abuse. Generally, you can install the VPN on as many devices as you like; it just can't be actively running on more than the limit.</p><p>If you're trying to connect to the VPN on a new device and it repeatedly disconnects, check how many other phones, computers or smart TVs it's already running on. Pay attention to devices where you have the VPN set to auto-connect on startup, as you may have missed that it's running. Disconnect from the VPN on one of those devices and try again on the new one.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-2-your-vpn-server-is-slow-or-overloaded\"><strong>2. Your VPN server is slow or overloaded</strong></h3><p>The problem often rests with the VPN server you're trying to connect to. Providers regularly shut down servers for routine maintenance. Sometimes, a server is technically online, but it's under such a heavy user load that it can't maintain a connection. It's also possible that the server is so physically far away from you that the connection keeps timing out.</p><p>In cases like these, the answer is simple: use another server. Pick a different server by disconnecting the VPN and reconnecting to the same location. If the new server has the same problems, try another location, assuming you don't need an IP address in a specific country.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-3-youre-using-an-unstable-vpn-protocol\"><strong>3. You're using an unstable VPN protocol</strong></h3><p>As I explained in my article on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-a-vpn-works-and-why-you-should-care-143000250.html\" target=\"_blank\">how a VPN works</a>, a VPN protocol is the set of instructions at the heart of everything a VPN does. Not all protocols are the same. For example, OpenVPN over TCP prioritizes speed over connection stability, causing more frequent disconnections. It's also possible for certain networks to block some VPN protocols but not others (see #8).</p><p>If changing servers didn't help your unstable connection, try switching protocols. WireGuard, OpenVPN over UDP and IKEv2 are best for stability. You can almost always find the protocol options in the Settings page of your VPN app.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-4-power-save-settings-are-interfering\"><strong>4. Power-save settings are interfering</strong></h3><p>A VPN almost always runs in the background. In some cases, a device's battery saver settings might shut down the VPN to stop the battery from draining. See if turning off power-save mode stops your VPN from disconnecting randomly (and maybe plug in your device while you're at it).</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-5-your-internet-connection-isnt-stable\"><strong>5. Your internet connection isn't stable</strong></h3><p>Your VPN needs to pass traffic through an ISP like any other online app — it just encrypts that traffic first. If you don't have a good internet connection, you won't have a good VPN connection. When you notice your VPN randomly disconnecting, check whether you have problems with your home internet connection. Resetting your modem by turning it off for at least 10 seconds may solve the problem, but you can also just wait for your internet to improve with time.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-6-another-program-is-interfering-with-the-vpn\"><strong>6. Another program is interfering with the VPN</strong></h3><p>Other security programs are a frequent cause of VPN disruptions. If you connect to an office VPN, for example, you likely won't be able to have a personal VPN running at the same time. Likewise, if you use an antivirus program or have a firewall on your device, it may be blocking your VPN from connecting. See if you can configure the firewall to allow traffic through a port used by a VPN protocol.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-7-your-software-is-out-of-date\"><strong>7. Your software is out of date</strong></h3><p>If none of the fixes have worked so far, you can often solve your connection problems by updating all the software involved. For optimal security, you should be installing updates the moment they're available anyway, so this will protect you even if it doesn't directly solve your VPN problem.</p><p>Update your VPN client and your operating system, then try connecting again. If you're still having problems, try updating your router. You can reach its control panel by entering its default IP address into the URL bar of your browser. Update it as well, then try once more.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-8-your-network-or-isp-is-blocking-vpn-traffic\"><strong>8. Your network or ISP is blocking VPN traffic</strong></h3><p>There's a chance that your problem originates with your network or ISP, not on the VPN or any device you own. Some networks, especially at offices and schools, automatically block any VPN traffic they detect. These restrictions can even be imposed by entire countries, most infamously in China.</p><p>Should this turn out to be your problem, turn on any obfuscation features that may be built into your VPN. Using an obfuscated protocol, connect to a server outside the location being censored, then use the internet as normal. This will be much more difficult if you're in a country where <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-legal-170000878.html\" target=\"_blank\">VPNs are illegal or restricted</a>, but there's still hope — if you can safely send an email, contact a VPN provider and ask if they'll send you a configuration directly. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Proton VPN</a> is one company that's officially willing to do that.</p><p>If you still find your VPN disconnecting mid-session, you may have a rare problem that doesn't show up on this list. Contact your VPN's support staff and do what they recommend. If possible, chat with a live support technician so you can tell them what you've already tried.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/why-does-my-vpn-keep-disconnecting-130000620.html?src=rss",

You’ll pay $72 upfront for 24 months of service, which amounts to 70 percent off the usual monthly rate and brings the long-term cost well below what many premium VPNs typically charge.</p><p>We’ve consistently been impressed by Proton VPN’s focus on privacy, its nonprofit ownership structure and the way it balances security features with strong real-world speeds. It’s a top pick in our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN guide</a>, and this promotion also appears in our running list of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN deals</a>. If you’re planning to commit to a VPN for the long haul, this pricing makes <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Proton VPN Plus</a> one of the more compelling options available right now.</p><p></p><p>In our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Proton VPN review</a>, the service impressed us with consistently fast performance and strong privacy protections. We measured average download speeds at 88 percent of our unprotected connection and upload speeds at 98 percent, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming and torrenting. It also unblocked Netflix in every region we tested, and while its Mac and iOS apps aren’t quite as polished as the Windows and Android versions, the service is still easy to install and largely set-it-and-forget-it across platforms. We gave Proton VPN a score of 90 out of 100.</p><p>Proton VPN Plus is the company’s premium tier and includes access to its full server network, which now spans more than 15,000 servers across 120-plus countries. A single subscription covers up to 10 devices at once and unlocks features like NetShield ad and malware blocking, Secure Core “double hop” connections, split tunneling, custom DNS controls and priority customer support. Proton VPN Plus also supports fast P2P traffic on nearly all paid servers and includes VPN Accelerator, which helps maintain high speeds over long-distance connections.</p><p>Right now, Proton VPN Plus is discounted to $2.99 per month when you commit to two years, billed as $72 upfront for the first 24 months. After that, the plan renews annually at $83.88. That’s a 70 percent discount compared to the standard monthly rate. As with Proton’s other paid plans, the subscription comes with a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-proton-vpn-and-get-a-refund-170014128.html\" target=\"_blank\">30-day money-back guarantee</a>, so you can try it risk-free if you’re not ready to lock in long term.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-two-years-of-proton-vpn-for-70-percent-off-right-now-123000652.html?src=rss",
