You can get the Advanced tier for $88 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.14 for the promo period.</p> \n<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html\">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> \n<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-up-to-81-percent-off-expressvpn-two-year-plans-180602916.html?src=rss",

Unlike most providers, Mullvad VPN does not automatically renew an expired subscription unless you tell it to. Thanks to its unique pricing approach, cancelling Mullvad is the default option.</p><p>When you sign up for Mullvad, you pay for as many months upfront as you want at the constant rate of 5 Euro per month (varying with exchange rates). Each month, Mullvad takes 5 Euro out of your account until there's nothing left. If you're no longer satisfied with Mullvad, all you have to do is stop putting money in.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Mullvad account dashboard.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Mullvad_add_time.png\" style=\"height: 1408px; width: 2736px;\" /><figcaption>The Mullvad account dashboard.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>If you happen to have originally signed up for Mullvad earlier than the middle of 2022, you may have an auto-renewal account grandfathered in. Mid-2022 is when Mullvad stopped auto-renewing subscriptions and got rid of PayPal integration altogether, but people who had signed up before then had the option to leave auto-renewal on.</p><p>If you're in this group, cancelling is simple. Just sign into your account page, click on the word <strong>Subscriptions, </strong>then click <strong>Unsubscribe.</strong></p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-cancel-mullvad-if-you-subscribed-through-an-app-store\"><strong>How to cancel Mullvad if you subscribed through an app store</strong></h2><p>There's one more exception to the usual method of cancelling Mullvad. If you got your subscription through an app store instead of Mullvad's website or app, the app store is the one processing your money. You'll need to cancel through them instead.</p><p>On an iPhone or iPad, open the <strong>Settings </strong>app, whose icon shows gray gears. <strong>Tap your name </strong>at the top of the screen to reach your Apple ID page, then tab <strong>Subscriptions. </strong>Scroll down until you find your Mullvad subscription, tap it, then hit <strong>Cancel Subscription.</strong></p><p>On an Android phone, open the <strong>Google Play Store</strong>, whose icon is a triangle in the Google colors. At the top-right, tap the circle with the first letter of your username in it. Hit <strong>Payments &amp; Subscriptions</strong>, scroll down to find Mullvad, then tap it and hit <strong>Cancel Subscription.</strong></p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-delete-your-mullvad-account\"><strong>How to delete your Mullvad account</strong></h2><p>You can go the extra mile and delete your account if you're sure you'll never want to use Mullvad again. Send an email to support@mullvadvpn.net, provide your account number and request that the account be terminated. You'll get a reply confirming deletion.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-get-a-refund-from-mullvad\"><strong>How to get a refund from Mullvad</strong></h2><p>Mullvad offers refunds on any purchase within 14 days. To start a refund request, send an email to support@mullvadvpn.net, including your Mullvad account number and your payment token. If you aren't sure what your payment token is, find the charge for Mullvad on your bank statement and look for something in the format VPN*(10-digit number).</p><p>Payments made in cash can't be refunded, apparently because that's considered a form of money laundering in Sweden. If you got Mullvad through a voucher, request your refund through the store the voucher came from.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-best-mullvad-alternatives\"><strong>Best Mullvad alternatives</strong></h2><p>Mullvad is one of the best VPNs, especially in terms of privacy. However, I've found it to be a bit slow at times, with a somewhat limited server network. Luckily, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Proton VPN</a> is almost as private as Mullvad — the only thing it's missing is the ability to sign up without an email. It's also got a larger server network and better overall download speeds.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/windscribe-review-despite-the-annoyances-it-has-the-right-idea-120000837.html\" target=\"_blank\">Windscribe</a> is another privacy-optimized VPN with a better record than Mullvad in my unblocking tests. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/surfshark-vpn-review-a-fast-vpn-for-casual-users-170022675.html\" target=\"_blank\">Surfshark</a> is the fastest VPN of them all, while <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html\" target=\"_blank\">ExpressVPN</a> is ideal for beginners. If you liked Mullvad's cheap pricing, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/cyberghost-vpn-review-despite-its-flaws-the-value-is-hard-to-beat-200000250.html\" target=\"_blank\">CyberGhost</a> is a highly affordable alternative.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-mullvad-vpn-200000516.html?src=rss",

Adding one to your account takes a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network so well established, locating missing items has never been easier.</p> \n<p>Using your iPhone you can trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively Precision Finding can be used to pinpoint its location via Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone, paying attention to the vibrations that signal you’re getting closer.</p> \n<p>A reminder again that the above deals apply to the first-generation AirTag only. Apple introduced a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\">tracker</a> with greater range and a louder speaker last month, which <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0GJTFXNRX&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e745850-e368-4111-83ab-157ddbe84ac4&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=retail&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmU3NDU4NTAtZTM2OC00MTExLTgzYWItMTU3ZGRiZTg0YWM0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaPN9LXQY-0xtODu-zAc_6biP338yFAO58xyoY7PRH7K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-AirTag-2nd-Generation-Precision%2Fdp%2FB0GJTFXNRX%2F\">retail</a>s at the same price as its predecessor.

These upgraded versions of microSD cards are the only ones compatible with the Switch 2 for expanding its storage, os if you're already starting to feel the crunch on your console, it's worth picking one up. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FT995SPF&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b7c1c9b1-8762-4b3b-bd34-558e13eba66f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Samsung%27s+P9+microSD+Express+card&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NhbXN1bmctRXhwcmVzcy1taWNyb1NEWEMtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoLUFNL2RwL0IwRlQ5OTVTUEY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjdjMWM5YjEtODc2Mi00YjNiLWJkMzQtNTU4ZTEzZWJhNjZmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NhbXN1bmctRXhwcmVzcy1taWNyb1NEWEMtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoLUFNL2RwL0IwRlQ5OTVTUEYiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT_twTWcajbKqdvcyEBHoh5RgsQUOS3jFfNNm7DTjYub&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSamsung-Express-microSDXC-Nintendo-Switch-AM%2Fdp%2FB0FT995SPF\">Samsung's P9 microSD Express card</a> is on sale right now — you can grab the 512GB version of $80, which is 33 percent off and one of the best prices we've seen.</p> \n<p>The P9 boasts transfer speeds of up to 800MB/s, making moving games to the card that much faster. As for load times, in our testing we found that any microSD Express, the standard the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2/\">Switch 2</a> requires, will offer roughly the same performance. This format is pretty new, so there aren't a ton of cards on the market. As such, the P9 makes our list of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html\">best microSD cards</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>The P9 microSD Express is also compatible with the Steam Deck or any other gaming console that accepts the format, as well as cameras and more.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-512gb-samsung-p9-microsd-express-card-is-33-percent-off-143849572.html?src=rss",

That works out to $72 billed upfront for the first 24 months, which represents a 70 percent discount compared to its regular pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">rated Proton VPN highly</a> thanks to its strong privacy credentials, transparent nonprofit backing and consistently fast performance. It’s one of the services we recommend in our guide to the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs</a>, and this deal also shows up alongside other standout offers in our ongoing roundup of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN deals</a>. It’s a good option if you’re looking to lock in long-term protection at a lower monthly cost.</p><p></p><p>In our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Proton VPN review</a>, the service impressed us with consistently fast performance and strong privacy protections. We measured average download speeds at 88 percent of our unprotected connection and upload speeds at 98 percent, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming and torrenting. It also unblocked Netflix in every region we tested, and while its Mac and iOS apps aren’t quite as polished as the Windows and Android versions, the service is still easy to install and largely set-it-and-forget-it across platforms. We gave Proton VPN a score of 90 out of 100.</p><p>Proton VPN Plus is the company’s premium tier and includes access to its full server network, which now spans more than 15,000 servers across 120-plus countries. A single subscription covers up to 10 devices at once and unlocks features like NetShield ad and malware blocking, Secure Core “double hop” connections, split tunneling, custom DNS controls and priority customer support. Proton VPN Plus also supports fast P2P traffic on nearly all paid servers and includes VPN Accelerator, which helps maintain high speeds over long-distance connections.</p><p>Right now, Proton VPN Plus is discounted to $2.99 per month when you commit to two years, billed as $72 upfront for the first 24 months. After that, the plan renews annually at $83.88. That’s a 70 percent discount compared to the standard monthly rate. As with Proton’s other paid plans, the subscription comes with a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-proton-vpn-and-get-a-refund-170014128.html\" target=\"_blank\">30-day money-back guarantee</a>, so you can try it risk-free if you’re not ready to lock in long term.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/proton-vpn-deal-get-up-to-70-percent-off-two-year-plans-123000585.html?src=rss",
