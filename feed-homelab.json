They also tend to be super expensive. However, most people will be served just fine with a robot vacuum that doesn’t choke at the first sign of dust bunnies or pet hair, and maybe has mopping capabilities if you want a machine that can tackle hard floors in addition to carpet. Those other innovations are nice-to-haves, not necessities.</p> \n<p>Arguably even bigger than CES announcements is the fact that iRobot, a name synonymous with smart cleaning robots, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/what-happened-to-irobot-can-happen-to-anyone-164500625.html\">filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> at the end of 2025. What does that mean for Roomba owners? Not too much immediately, as the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/irobot-has-filed-for-bankruptcy-and-may-be-taken-over-by-its-primary-supplier-091602257.html\">stated</a> that it will continue to operate with “no anticipated disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships or ongoing product support.&quot; However, this also means that buying a new Roomba in 2026 is a questionable decision.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-the-best-robot-vacuums\">What to look for in the best robot vacuums</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-tldr\">TLDR</h3> \n<p>Despite companies coming out with gimmicky extras and new software perks in their robot vacuum lineups, the core competency of these devices have remained the same for years: sucking up dirt without needing your attention. You want a robot vacuum with the strongest suction power you can afford. Those with tile and hardwood floors can consider robovacs with mopping capabilities, and those who want peak convenience should opt for a model with a self-emptying base. However, both of those extra features will cost extra.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-floor-type\"><strong>Floor type</strong></h3> \n<p>First and foremost, we recommend considering the floors in your home: Do you have carpet throughout, or tile and hardwood floors, or a mix? Robots with stronger suction power will do a better job picking up dirt on carpets as they can get into high piles more easily. Some machines have “max” modes as well, which ups suction power, but also typically eats battery life faster than the “normal” floor cleaning mode.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-vacuum-suction\"><strong>Vacuum suction</strong></h3> \n<p>Suction power is an important factor to consider. Unfortunately, there isn’t a standard power scale that all robovacs adhere to, so it’s difficult to compare among a bunch of devices. Some companies provide Pascal (Pa) levels and generally the higher the Pa, the stronger the vacuum cleaner will be. But other companies don’t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you’re looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it’s helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the machine can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wi-fi-connectivity\"><strong>Wi-Fi connectivity</strong></h3> \n<p>Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren’t Wi-Fi connected, so it’s best to double check before you buy something on the low end of affordable. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-mapping-features-and-object-detection\"><strong>Mapping features and object detection</strong></h3> \n<p>Past a certain price threshold, you’ll find advanced perks like home mapping features and improved object detection. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home’s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don’t want it to roam.</p> \n<p>Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children’s toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-mopping-capabilities\">Mopping capabilities</h3> \n<p>Mopping features are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines that support this will have a water tank either built into the robot’s chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part.</p> \n<p>Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human’s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-self-empty-station-inclusion\">Self-empty station inclusion</h3> \n<p>Finally, for peak convenience, consider a robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine’s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base – that means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you’ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks.</p> \n<p>Just keep in mind that many self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags – another long-term expense you’ll have to factor in (look for mentions of “bagless” to avoid this all together). Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you’ll still have to clean up that yourself.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-robot-vacuum-maintenance-tips\">Robot vacuum maintenance tips</h2> \n<p>First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there’s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to the insides.</p> \n<p>In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards.</p> \n<p>Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-robot-vacuums\">How we test robot vacuums</h2> \n<p>We primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies, stairs (gasp) and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine.</p> \n<p>If the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum's mobile app for usability and convenience. As we're testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-robot-vacuum-faqs\">Robot vacuum FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-are-robot-vacuums-worth-it\">Are robot vacuums worth it?</h3> \n<p>We tackled this question when we reviewed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html\">budget robot vacuums</a> and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere.</p> \n<p>That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-long-do-robot-vacuums-last\">How long do robot vacuums last?</h3> \n<p>Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-robot-vacuums-work-better-than-handheld-vacuums\">Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums?</h3> \n<p>There's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-often-do-you-have-to-clean-a-robot-vacuum\">How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum?</h3> \n<p>Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-negatives-of-robot-vacuums\">What are the negatives of robot vacuums?</h3> \n<p>Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-cordless-vacuum-130007125.html\">cordless stick vacuum</a>, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.</p> \n<p><em>Check out more from our </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/spring-cleaning/\"><em>spring cleaning</em></a><em> guide.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html?src=rss</p>",

But other companies don’t rely on Pa and simply say their robots have X-times more suction than other robots. If you’re looking for the best vacuum for your needs, it’s helpful to pay attention to real-world testing and how well the machine can pick up fine dust, crumbs and pet hair in an environment similar to that of your home.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-wi-fi-connectivity\"><strong>Wi-Fi connectivity</strong></h3> \n<p>Wi-Fi connectivity is a key feature for most robot vacuums. Some of the affordable devices aren’t Wi-Fi connected, so it’s best to double check before you buy something on the low end of affordable. Wi-Fi lets a robot vacuum cleaner do things like communicate with a mobile app, which then allows you to control the device from your phone.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-mapping-features-and-object-detection\"><strong>Mapping features and object detection</strong></h3> \n<p>Past a certain price threshold, you’ll find advanced perks like home mapping features and improved object detection. Home mapping is exactly what it sounds like: The vacuum uses sensors to map your home’s layout as it cleans, allowing you to send it to particular rooms or avoid no-go zones where you don’t want it to roam.</p> \n<p>Most robo-vacs have object detection, but some will be better than others at actually avoiding things like chair legs and children’s toys. High-end models even go so far as to promise obstacle avoidance to steer clear of things like pet poop that can potentially ruin your machine.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-mopping-capabilities\">Mopping capabilities</h3> \n<p>Mopping features are much more common now in robot vacuums than they were just five years ago. Machines that support this will have a water tank either built into the robot’s chassis, the auto-empty bin or as a separate piece that you swap in for the dustbin when you want to mop your floors. It makes the robo-vac more useful if you have hard floors in your home that you like to keep squeaky clean, but it does require more work on your part.</p> \n<p>Filling and emptying the reservoir remains a human’s job for the most part (except on the most expensive machines), as does adding cleaning solutions if the mopping robot comes with this feature to ensure it uses clean water for every cycle.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-self-empty-station-inclusion\">Self-empty station inclusion</h3> \n<p>Finally, for peak convenience, consider a robot vacuum that comes with a self-empty station. These are basically garbage bins attached to the machine’s docking station. At the end of each job, the robo-vac automatically empties its small dustbin into the large clean base – that means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself and you’ll only have to tend to the base once every few weeks.</p> \n<p>Just keep in mind that many self-emptying bins require proprietary garbage bags – another long-term expense you’ll have to factor in (look for mentions of “bagless” to avoid this all together). Also, any vac-and-mop robot with a water tank will not dump its dirty water into the clean base, so you’ll still have to clean up that yourself.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-robot-vacuum-maintenance-tips\">Robot vacuum maintenance tips</h2> \n<p>First and foremost, always empty your robot vacuum’s dustbin after every cleaning job. If you have a model with a self-emptying base, there’s less work for you to do yourself. If not, simply detach and empty the dustbin as soon as the robot is done cleaning. It’s also a good idea to take a dry cloth to the inside of the dustbin every once in a while to remove any small dust and dirt particles clinging to the insides.</p> \n<p>In addition, you’ll want to regularly examine the machine’s brush roll to see if any hair has wrapped around them, or if any large debris is preventing them from working properly. Some brushes are better than others at not succumbing to tangled hair, but it’s a good idea to check your robot’s brushes regardless — both their main brush and any smaller roller brushes or corner brushes they have. These parts are often easy to pop off of the machine (because they do require replacements eventually) so we recommend removing each brush entirely, getting rid of any tangled hair or other debris attached to them and reinstalling them afterwards.</p> \n<p>Robot vacuums also have filters that need replacing every couple of months. Check your machine’s user manual or the manufacturer’s website to see how long they recommend going in between filter replacements. Most of the time, these filters cannot be washed, so you will need to buy new ones either directly from the manufacturer or from other retailers like Amazon or Walmart.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-robot-vacuums\">How we test robot vacuums</h2> \n<p>We primarily test robot vacuums by using them as they are intended to be used: in a home, across different types of flooring and in the face of all sorts of messes including pet hair, spilt coffee grounds and other food debris, dust bunnies, stairs (gasp) and more. We set up all robot vacuums according to their provided instructions and run multiple cleaning jobs during a testing period of at least one to two weeks per machine.</p> \n<p>If the robot has mopping capabilities, we also test those as well on hardwood and tile flooring. For models with self-emptying bases, we rely on those built-in trash cans for all post-job cleaning, and we make sure to test the robot vacuum's mobile app for usability and convenience. As we're testing, we make note of things like how loud the robot and its components are, how much human attention the robot needs on a regular basis, how the robot handles large messes and big dust bunnies, if the robot gets stuck on rugs, doormats or other furniture and more.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-robot-vacuum-faqs\">Robot vacuum FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-are-robot-vacuums-worth-it\">Are robot vacuums worth it?</h3> \n<p>We tackled this question when we reviewed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html\">budget robot vacuums</a> and the answer is yes, especially if vacuuming is one of your least favorite chores. Robots take the hard work out of cleaning your floors – just turn the thing on and watch it go. Any robot vacuum cleaner worth buying is semi-autonomous in that it will suck up dirt around your home until its battery is low and then make its way back to its charging dock. Unlike a regular vacuum, you should only have to interact with it to turn it on, empty its dustbin and untangle it if it were to get stuck somewhere.</p> \n<p>That’s not to say robot vacuums are perfect. They’re almost always less powerful and less flexible than traditional vacuums. Since most robo-vacs are much smaller than traditional models, they often don’t have the same level of suction you’ll get in an upright machine. Plus, their dustbins are smaller, so they will need to be emptied more frequently. While Wi-Fi-connected robot vacuums give you the flexibility to start a cleaning job from anywhere using an app, targeting a small area of your home can be more complicated. Some robo-vacs have spot-cleaning features that focus the machine’s attention on a specific area, which almost – but not quite – mimics the spot-cleaning you’d be able to do yourself with a regular or cordless vacuum.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-long-do-robot-vacuums-last\">How long do robot vacuums last?</h3> \n<p>Robot vacuums can last many years, if you take care of them properly. Check out our recommendations for robot vacuum maintenance above, but in a nutshell, you should make sure that you're emptying the machine's bin after every job and periodically cleaning the interior of the bin and the brushes. It's also a good idea to check the user manual to see how often your robot vacuum's filter needs changing.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-robot-vacuums-work-better-than-handheld-vacuums\">Do robot vacuums work better than handheld vacuums?</h3> \n<p>There's no straight answer to this question. Robot vacuums offer more convenience than handheld vacuums, so for those who are looking to automate a chore, that could mean one of these devices works better for them than a standard vacuum. However, handheld vacuum cleaners often have stronger suction power, and they give the user a bit more control. It ultimately depends on how you intend to use your main vacuum cleaner and what you want to prioritize most.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-often-do-you-have-to-clean-a-robot-vacuum\">How often do you have to clean a robot vacuum?</h3> \n<p>Cleaning a robot vacuum isn’t too much of a chore, but you’ll want to give it a little TLC every few weeks or so, depending on how often you’re running it and how much dirt it’s picking up. The dustbin usually needs to be emptied after each cleaning run, especially if you have pets or lots of carpet where dirt can hide. Many newer models have self-emptying docks, which means you won’t have to empty the dustbin yourself after every use, but the main bin will still need a good clean once a month or so. Also, it’s a good idea to check the side brushes and main brush for any hair tangles or debris every couple of weeks to keep things running smoothly.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-negatives-of-robot-vacuums\">What are the negatives of robot vacuums?</h3> \n<p>Robot vacuums won’t work for everyone. One of the biggest drawbacks is that they usually don’t have the same suction power as a full-sized upright vacuum or even a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-cordless-vacuum-130007125.html\">cordless stick vacuum</a>, so they might struggle with deep-cleaning thick carpets. They’re also designed for floors only, so if you’re looking to clean furniture, stairs or other tricky spots, you’ll still need a traditional vacuum to do that. Plus, they can sometimes get stuck or miss spots, especially if you’ve got a lot of furniture or obstacles in the way. While their sensors help, they might still bump into things or need a little help getting out of tight spots. And while most have decent dirt detection features, they’re best for keeping things tidy rather than doing heavy-duty cleaning.</p> \n<p><em>Check out more from our </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/spring-cleaning/\"><em>spring cleaning</em></a><em> guide.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-robot-vacuums-130010426.html?src=rss",

The <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs</a> all work in the background to keep your IP address hidden and your communications with their servers encrypted. The better the VPN, the less you notice it, which can make a top-performing VPN feel (uncomfortably) like one that isn't working at all.</p><p>Luckily, you've got options for checking whether your VPN is working — other than just taking the app at its word. In this article, I'll cover the basics, then go through five different tests you can run to make sure you're actually using an encrypted VPN server.

For all the tests I'll discuss across the rest of this article, make sure you're connected to a VPN server before you run them. Also, make sure your internet connection is active — a VPN can only work when there's internet.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-5-tests-to-check-if-your-vpn-works\"><strong>5 tests to check if your VPN works</strong></h2><p>Each of these tests investigates a different reason your VPN might not be working. We'll start by looking for connection problems that might not be obvious, check for DNS leaks, WebRTC leaks and IPv6 leaks, then finally make sure an apparently active VPN is managing to change your virtual location.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-1-has-your-ip-address-changed\"><strong>1. Has your IP address changed?</strong></h3><p>Websites and internet service providers (ISPs) use IP addresses to identify devices and their owners online. A VPN's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html\" target=\"_blank\">most important job</a> is to change your IP address to one matching its own server, which disassociates your identity from your online activities. Not doing this indicates a failure on a fundamental level: either the VPN says it's connected when it isn't, or its technology is active but somehow not sending you through the proper encrypted tunnel.</p><p>To check whether your VPN has changed your IP address, start by going to an IP address checker like <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://whatismyipaddress.com\" target=\"_blank\"><a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\">whatismyipaddress.com</a></a> or <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://ipleak.net\" target=\"_blank\"><a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\">ipleak.net</a></a>. This will show you the public IP address that everyone sees when you get online without a VPN, including the ISP that holds it and the geographic location it's associated with. Write that down or take a screenshot.</p><figure><img alt=\"A censored report from WhatIsMyIPAddress.com.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/whatismyipaddress_2970.png\" style=\"height: 1566px; width: 2741px;\" /><figcaption>A censored report from WhatIsMyIPAddress.com.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Next, connect to your VPN. Remember the location you connect to, and note down the new server IP address if the VPN tells you what it is. Go back to your IP tester tool and refresh the page. You should now see an IP address and location that match the one you connected to through the VPN, including a different ISP.</p><p>If your IP address is the same as before, your VPN isn't working. To fix this, try disconnecting from the server, waiting about 10 seconds, then connecting to the same location and trying the test again. This will show you whether the problem was with one individual server or an entire location.</p><p>If the problem persists, try a different server location, then a different VPN protocol. If it's still leaking, try restarting your VPN client, your device and your modem (in that order). This should fix the problem, but if it doesn't, move on to the remaining tests or get in touch with the VPN's tech support.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-2-are-you-leaking-dns-requests\"><strong>2. Are you leaking DNS requests?</strong></h3><p>A domain name system (DNS) server is an important step in getting a website to appear on your browser. DNS holds the information that connects URLs to the IP addresses of destination servers. If a VPN client lets your device contact a DNS server owned by your internet service provider without routing it through an encrypted tunnel first, the DNS request might reveal your real IP address to the ISP.</p><p>You can check for DNS leaks by connecting to your VPN, then going to <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://dnsleaktest.com\" target=\"_blank\"><a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\">dnsleaktest.com</a></a> or another tool of your choice. The tester sends several innocuous DNS requests, then scans to see which servers resolve them. If you see your real ISP at all, you've got DNS leaks.</p><figure><img alt=\"A DNS leak test run without a VPN. With one active, my real ISP (Comcast) should not appear on the list.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dnsleaktest.png\" style=\"height: 1645px; width: 2028px;\" /><figcaption>A DNS leak test run without a VPN. With one active, my real ISP (Comcast) should not appear on the list.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>The fix for DNS leaks is more intensive than the fixes in step #1. Check your VPN's control panel to activate any DNS leak protections and try again. IPv6 leaks can also appear as DNS leaks, so try disabling IPv6 in your browser (see #4 below for instructions). If you keep seeing leaks, you can also try clearing your computer's DNS cache.</p><p>Here's how to do that. On Windows, go to the <strong>Command Prompt </strong>(on Windows 10) or the <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Terminal </strong>(on Windows 11). Enter the phrase <strong>ipconfig/flushdns.</strong> On Mac, open <strong>Terminal </strong>from the Utilities folder, then paste in the phrase <strong>sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder </strong>and hit Enter. Test the VPN once more to see if it's still leaking.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-3-are-you-leaking-information-through-webrtc\"><strong>3. Are you leaking information through WebRTC?</strong></h3><p>WebRTC, which stands for Web Real-Time Communication, is a technology that lets browsers exchange information directly with each other. This is useful for text and video chats, streaming and more, but it's also a potential security risk. WebRTC can serve as a backchannel that inadvertently sends your real IP address outside the VPN tunnel.</p><p>It's pretty easy to test for WebRTC leaks. I recommend the tool <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://ipleak.net\" target=\"_blank\"><a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\">ipleak.net</a></a>, which checks for them as a matter of course. You can also use <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://browserleaks.com/webrtc\" target=\"_blank\">browserleaks.com/webrtc</a> to run a test that's particular to this kind of leak. These tools establish dummy connections through WebRTC, then test to see if the VPN still works when they're active. As usual, if you see your real IP address, there's a problem.</p><figure><img alt=\"Your WebRTC IP not matching your Remote IP is a potential red flag.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/WebRTC_leak_test.png\" style=\"height: 1900px; width: 1976px;\" /><figcaption>Your WebRTC IP not matching your Remote IP is a potential red flag.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>The fixes for a WebRTC leak are the usual ones: try different servers, locations and protocols, reset your VPN, device and modem, then try another VPN provider. However, if nothing is working, you can also disable WebRTC on your browser altogether. This means you won't be able to do any real-time chatting (that's Zoom, Google Meet, Teams and so on), so it's a last-resort solution.</p><p>To disable WebRTC on Firefox, type <strong>about:config </strong>in the URL bar, click the message to accept the risk, type <strong>media.peerconnection.enabled </strong>in the search bar, then double-click the word <strong>True </strong>to change it to <strong>False. </strong>To turn WebRTC back on, just double-click <strong>False </strong>again.</p><p>On Edge, you can disable WebRTC by entering <strong>edge://flags </strong>in the URL bar, scrolling down to the option &quot;Anonymize local IPs exposed by WebRTC&quot; and making sure the dropdown next to it is set to <strong>Enable.</strong> There's no built-in way to turn off WebRTC on Chrome, but you can install the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/webrtc-control/fjkmabmdepjfammlpliljpnbhleegehm?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">WebRTC Control</a> extension to switch it off and on yourself.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-4-is-your-ipv6-address-leaking\"><strong>4. Is your IPv6 address leaking?</strong></h3><p>Next up, it's possible that your real location is leaking through your IPv6 address, not IPv4. To make a long explanation short, IPv6 is a new way of formatting IP addresses that leaves more options available for the future. Since we haven't yet hit the crisis point of IPv4 shortage, very few websites are restricted to IPv6 alone.</p><p>The problem is that most VPN apps were designed in the IPv4 era and aren't built to protect IPv6 traffic. There are some exceptions, including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html\" target=\"_blank\">NordVPN</a>, but most VPNs block IPv6 traffic completely rather than retrofit themselves to work with it. However, if a VPN of that sort isn't blocking IPv6 entirely, your IPv6 address and associated location can leak.</p><p>Any IP address checker can reveal an IPv6 leak, but you can find a specific test at <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://test-ipv6.com\" target=\"_blank\"><a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\">test-ipv6.com</a></a>. This site runs several exams that look for IPv6 readiness, but the most important line is the one that shows your current IPv6 address. This will probably say you don't have one, since most ISPs don't work through IPv6 yet — but if you do have one, it should match your active VPN's location, not your real one.</p><figure><img alt=\"If your IPv4 address matches the VPN server but your IPv6 address does not, IPv6 is the likely cause of your leak.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IPv6_leak_test.png\" style=\"height: 1015px; width: 3434px;\" /><figcaption>If your IPv4 address matches the VPN server but your IPv6 address does not, IPv6 is the likely cause of your leak.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Should it turn out that you're leaking IPv6 requests, the easiest solution is to disable IPv6 on your computer. On Windows, you can do this through the network adapter options page of your control panel. Here's how to get there:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Windows 10: </strong>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network &amp; internet -&gt; Status -&gt; Change -&gt; Advanced network settings -&gt; Change adapter options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Windows 11: </strong>Settings app -&gt; Network &amp; internet -&gt; Advanced network settings -&gt; Related settings -&gt; More network adapter options.</p></li></ul><p>On both OSes, finish the job by right-clicking the name of your internet connection, selecting <strong>Properties </strong>from the dropdown and unchecking the box next to <strong>Internet Protocol Version 6</strong>. Of course, you can always switch to another VPN that blocks IPv6 altogether, but you might find that to be a bigger hassle.</p><p>If you're on Mac, open <strong>System Settings</strong>, click the <strong>Network </strong>tab and then click the <strong>Details... </strong>button next to your network name. In the new window, click the <strong>TCP/IP </strong>tab on the left, find the entry labeled <strong>Configure IPv6 </strong>and set the dropdown to <strong>Link-Local Only.</strong></p><h3 id=\"jump-link-5-do-streaming-sites-show-different-content\"><strong>5. Do streaming sites show different content?</strong></h3><p>A VPN can be working perfectly and still fail to unblock streaming sites. Netflix, HBO Max and the others block VPN traffic because VPNs can make them show material in regions where they don't hold the copyright. To avoid legal trouble, they set up their firewalls to block IP addresses known to belong to VPN servers.</p><p>If your VPN can't get into a streaming platform, it'll usually be obvious; the site will either display a proxy error message or simply refuse to load. However, in rare cases, the streaming site will load fine but show you the same shows you normally see. This indicates that you might be dealing with a VPN leak.</p><p>If that happens, follow the usual steps. Disconnect and reconnect to the same location to get a different server, then try different server locations. It's also possible that the streaming site is getting your real location from your browser cache, so if the problem persists, clear your cache and cookies and try again.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-test-a-vpn-kill-switch\"><strong>How to test a VPN kill switch</strong></h2><p>There's one more important step to make sure your VPN is working: test the kill switch. This common feature cuts off your internet connection if you lose touch with your VPN server. With your kill switch active, you shouldn't be at any risk of accidentally broadcasting your real IP address, location or online activity.</p><p>To test your kill switch, you'll need to simulate an abrupt loss of VPN connectivity. Open your VPN, make sure the kill switch is turned on, then connect to a server. Next, quit the VPN app without disconnecting. At this point, the kill switch should make it impossible for you to get online — if you can still browse the internet as normal, the switch might be faulty.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-check-if-your-vpn-is-working-130000817.html?src=rss</p>",

There are some exceptions, including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html\" target=\"_blank\">NordVPN</a>, but most VPNs block IPv6 traffic completely rather than retrofit themselves to work with it. However, if a VPN of that sort isn't blocking IPv6 entirely, your IPv6 address and associated location can leak.</p><p>Any IP address checker can reveal an IPv6 leak, but you can find a specific test at <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://test-ipv6.com\" target=\"_blank\"><a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\">test-ipv6.com</a></a>. This site runs several exams that look for IPv6 readiness, but the most important line is the one that shows your current IPv6 address. This will probably say you don't have one, since most ISPs don't work through IPv6 yet — but if you do have one, it should match your active VPN's location, not your real one.</p><figure><img alt=\"If your IPv4 address matches the VPN server but your IPv6 address does not, IPv6 is the likely cause of your leak.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/IPv6_leak_test.png\" style=\"height: 1015px; width: 3434px;\" /><figcaption>If your IPv4 address matches the VPN server but your IPv6 address does not, IPv6 is the likely cause of your leak.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Chapman for Engadget</div></figure><p>Should it turn out that you're leaking IPv6 requests, the easiest solution is to disable IPv6 on your computer. On Windows, you can do this through the network adapter options page of your control panel. Here's how to get there:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Windows 10: </strong>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network &amp; internet -&gt; Status -&gt; Change -&gt; Advanced network settings -&gt; Change adapter options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Windows 11: </strong>Settings app -&gt; Network &amp; internet -&gt; Advanced network settings -&gt; Related settings -&gt; More network adapter options.</p></li></ul><p>On both OSes, finish the job by right-clicking the name of your internet connection, selecting <strong>Properties </strong>from the dropdown and unchecking the box next to <strong>Internet Protocol Version 6</strong>. Of course, you can always switch to another VPN that blocks IPv6 altogether, but you might find that to be a bigger hassle.</p><p>If you're on Mac, open <strong>System Settings</strong>, click the <strong>Network </strong>tab and then click the <strong>Details... </strong>button next to your network name. In the new window, click the <strong>TCP/IP </strong>tab on the left, find the entry labeled <strong>Configure IPv6 </strong>and set the dropdown to <strong>Link-Local Only.</strong></p><h3 id=\"jump-link-5-do-streaming-sites-show-different-content\"><strong>5. Do streaming sites show different content?</strong></h3><p>A VPN can be working perfectly and still fail to unblock streaming sites. Netflix, HBO Max and the others block VPN traffic because VPNs can make them show material in regions where they don't hold the copyright. To avoid legal trouble, they set up their firewalls to block IP addresses known to belong to VPN servers.</p><p>If your VPN can't get into a streaming platform, it'll usually be obvious; the site will either display a proxy error message or simply refuse to load. However, in rare cases, the streaming site will load fine but show you the same shows you normally see. This indicates that you might be dealing with a VPN leak.</p><p>If that happens, follow the usual steps. Disconnect and reconnect to the same location to get a different server, then try different server locations. It's also possible that the streaming site is getting your real location from your browser cache, so if the problem persists, clear your cache and cookies and try again.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-test-a-vpn-kill-switch\"><strong>How to test a VPN kill switch</strong></h2><p>There's one more important step to make sure your VPN is working: test the kill switch. This common feature cuts off your internet connection if you lose touch with your VPN server. With your kill switch active, you shouldn't be at any risk of accidentally broadcasting your real IP address, location or online activity.</p><p>To test your kill switch, you'll need to simulate an abrupt loss of VPN connectivity. Open your VPN, make sure the kill switch is turned on, then connect to a server. Next, quit the VPN app without disconnecting. At this point, the kill switch should make it impossible for you to get online — if you can still browse the internet as normal, the switch might be faulty.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-check-if-your-vpn-is-working-130000817.html?src=rss",
