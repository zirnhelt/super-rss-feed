These upgraded versions of microSD cards are the only ones compatible with the Switch 2 for expanding its storage, os if you're already starting to feel the crunch on your console, it's worth picking one up. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FT995SPF&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b7c1c9b1-8762-4b3b-bd34-558e13eba66f&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Samsung%27s+P9+microSD+Express+card&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NhbXN1bmctRXhwcmVzcy1taWNyb1NEWEMtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoLUFNL2RwL0IwRlQ5OTVTUEY_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjdjMWM5YjEtODc2Mi00YjNiLWJkMzQtNTU4ZTEzZWJhNjZmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NhbXN1bmctRXhwcmVzcy1taWNyb1NEWEMtTmludGVuZG8tU3dpdGNoLUFNL2RwL0IwRlQ5OTVTUEYiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAT_twTWcajbKqdvcyEBHoh5RgsQUOS3jFfNNm7DTjYub&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSamsung-Express-microSDXC-Nintendo-Switch-AM%2Fdp%2FB0FT995SPF\">Samsung's P9 microSD Express card</a> is on sale right now — you can grab the 512GB version of $80, which is 33 percent off and one of the best prices we've seen.</p> \n<p>The P9 boasts transfer speeds of up to 800MB/s, making moving games to the card that much faster. As for load times, in our testing we found that any microSD Express, the standard the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2/\">Switch 2</a> requires, will offer roughly the same performance. This format is pretty new, so there aren't a ton of cards on the market. As such, the P9 makes our list of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/best-microsd-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-160052947.html\">best microSD cards</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>The P9 microSD Express is also compatible with the Steam Deck or any other gaming console that accepts the format, as well as cameras and more.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-the-512gb-samsung-p9-microsd-express-card-for-33-percent-off-right-now-143849920.html?src=rss",
