Once everything is set up, Apple Health can show how long you slept each night, how consistent your sleep schedule is and how much time you spend in different sleep stages. Here is how to get started, track your sleep and review your data.</p><p>Sleep tracking in Apple Health relies on two things: You need to set up Sleep in the Health app on your iPhone, and you need a compatible Apple Watch to wear to bed. While you can set sleep schedules without a watch, detailed sleep data — including sleep stages — requires an Apple Watch.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-set-up-sleep-in-apple-health\">How to set up Sleep in Apple Health</h2><p>Sleep tracking is available on all watchOS 8 (or later) models and setup starts in the <strong>Health app</strong> on your iPhone. Open <strong>Health</strong>, tap <strong>Browse</strong> and then tap <strong>Sleep</strong>. If this is your first time setting it up, you will see an option to get started. Apple Health will guide you through choosing a sleep goal, setting a bedtime and wake-up time and deciding whether you want one sleep schedule for every day or different schedules for weekdays and weekends.</p><p>During setup, you can also enable sleep reminders and a wind-down period. <strong>Wind Down</strong> reduces distractions before bedtime by activating features like <strong>Focus mode</strong> and dimming notifications at a set time before sleep. These settings are optional but they help keep your schedule consistent, which improves the quality of the data Apple Health collects over time.</p><p>Once Sleep is configured, Apple Health automatically syncs those settings to your Apple Watch. You can adjust your sleep schedule later by returning to the Sleep section in Health and tapping Full Schedule and Options. Any changes you make here update on both your iPhone and Apple Watch.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-prepare-your-apple-watch-for-sleep-tracking\">How to prepare your Apple Watch for sleep tracking</h2><p>To track sleep, your Apple Watch needs to be worn overnight and have enough battery to last until morning. If the battery drops below 30 percent before bedtime, your watch will prompt you to charge it first. Sleep tracking also relies on <strong>Sleep Focus </strong>which activates automatically based on your sleep schedule.  Once Sleep Focus has been set, open the Settings app on your Apple Watch, tap <strong>Sleep</strong> and ensure that<strong> Track Sleep with Apple Watch </strong>is turned on. With both features enabled your watch can monitor sleep automatically without any manual start or stop each night.&nbsp;</p><p>Comfort matters when wearing a watch to bed, so many people prefer a softer band for sleep. As long as the watch fits securely and stays in contact with your wrist, it can track sleep without issue.</p><figure><img alt=\"The Apple Watch Series 11 on a person's wrist, showing a ring with three segmented arcs encircling a Sleep Score of 53 and the description &quot;OK&quot; in the bottom left.\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/acf51d20-9296-11f0-9146-7e82dd205a74\" style=\"height: 4000px; width: 6000px;\" /><figcaption>The Apple Watch Series 11 on a person's wrist, showing a ring with three segmented arcs encircling a Sleep Score of 53 and the description &quot;OK&quot; in the bottom left.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Cherlynn Low for Engadget</div></figure><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-apple-watch-tracks-your-sleep\">How Apple Watch tracks your sleep</h2><p>When Sleep Focus is active, the Apple Watch uses its accelerometer and heart rate sensor to detect when you are asleep and awake. Newer models also track sleep stages, including time spent in REM, core and deep sleep. Apple Health combines this information into a single overnight record that appears in the Sleep section the next morning.</p><p>You do not need to start or stop sleep tracking manually. As long as you follow your sleep schedule or enable Sleep Focus before bed, the Apple Watch automatically does everything else. If you wake up early or go to bed later than planned, Apple Health adjusts the data based on actual movement and heart rate rather than just your scheduled times.  In addition, some Apple Watch models (SE 3 or higher) support on-device Siri, enabling you to ask questions such as “how much sleep did I have last night?” for a more immediate response.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-view-your-sleep-data-in-apple-health\">How to view your sleep data in Apple Health</h2><p>To see your sleep data, open the <strong>Health</strong> app on your iPhone and tap <strong>Browse</strong>, then <strong>Sleep</strong>. At the top of the screen, you will see a chart showing how long you slept the previous night. Tapping this chart reveals a detailed breakdown, including time asleep, time in bed and sleep stages (if available).</p><p>Scrolling down shows trends over longer periods. You can switch between daily, weekly, monthly and six-month views to see patterns in your sleep duration and consistency. Apple Health also highlights whether you are meeting your sleep goal and how regular your schedule has been.</p><p>Under Highlights, Apple Health may surface insights such as changes in average sleep time, variations in sleep stages or your nightly sleep score. Sleep scores provide a simplified summary of how well you slept, and is based on factors such as duration, consistency and restfulness. These summaries update automatically as more data is collected over time.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-understanding-sleep-stages-and-trends\">Understanding sleep stages and trends</h2><p>If your Apple Watch supports sleep stages, Apple Health displays how much time you spent in REM, core and deep sleep. These stages give context to your overall sleep quality, though Apple emphasizes trends over individual nights. Occasional short nights or unusual stage distributions are normal.</p><p>Over time, Apple Health makes it easier to spot patterns. Consistently short sleep durations, irregular bedtimes or frequent awakenings become clearer when viewing weekly or monthly summaries. This makes the Sleep section useful not just for nightly check-ins but for understanding longer-term habits.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-editing-and-managing-sleep-data\">Editing and managing sleep data</h2><p>Apple Health allows you to add or edit sleep data if needed manually. In the <strong>Sleep</strong> section, tap <strong>Add</strong> <strong>Data</strong> to log sleep that was not recorded automatically. This can be useful if you forget to wear your watch or take a nap without it.</p><p>You can also manage which devices contribute sleep data by scrolling to the bottom of the Sleep screen and tapping <strong>Data Sources and Access</strong>. This is helpful if you use third-party sleep apps or multiple devices.</p><p>Once set up, sleep tracking in Apple Health runs quietly in the background. With a consistent schedule and a charged Apple Watch, your sleep data builds into a clear picture of your nightly rest, all stored securely within Apple’s health platform.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-track-your-sleep-and-view-your-sleep-data-in-apple-health-130000023.html?src=rss",

Several of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs</a> let you try them out without paying. A rare few, and only one on this list, let you try them without submitting payment information at all. Some VPNs have <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html\" target=\"_blank\">forever free plans</a> that let you use them indefinitely without paying, as long as you're OK with some limits.<br /><br />For the most part, though, your best chance to test a VPN for free is to pay for a subscription. Then, if you don't like the service, you can get your money back before the refund guarantee expires. This takes a bit more work, and some services have very tight turnarounds. However, it'll get you the most time with the most complete version of the VPN.<br /><br />With that out of the way, let's talk about the best VPN free trials for each definition of &quot;free trial.&quot; I'll start with VPNs that actually have free trials, most of which require a payment method and only work on mobile devices. The next section lists the best forever free plans. Finally, I'll share instructions for how to use a VPN money-back guarantee as a free trial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-vpns-with-free-trials\"><strong>Best VPNs with free trials</strong></h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-vpn-forever-free-plans\"><strong>Best VPN forever free plans</strong></h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-using-vpn-money-back-guarantees-as-free-trials\"><strong>Using VPN money-back guarantees as free trials</strong></h2>\n<p>Although VPN free trials are great when you can get them, you'll enjoy a lot more flexibility by taking advantage of refund guarantees. Almost every provider has a money-back guarantee that doesn't require you to prove a specific problem. You'll probably have to deflect some upselling attempts before you actually get the refund, but most policies do promise you all your money back, with no pro-rating.</p>\n<p>I like to download VPNs on their one-month plans so I can put the full service through <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html\" target=\"_blank\">my usual battery of tests</a>. A 30-day money-back guarantee grants you enough time to learn whether you can use the VPN long-term. If you don't like the service, the standard method for getting a refund is to get in touch with customer support on the VPN provider's help page.</p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpns-with-free-trials-130000435.html?src=rss",

You’ll pay $72 upfront for 24 months of service, which amounts to 70 percent off the usual monthly rate and brings the long-term cost well below what many premium VPNs typically charge.</p><p>We’ve consistently been impressed by Proton VPN’s focus on privacy, its nonprofit ownership structure and the way it balances security features with strong real-world speeds. It’s a top pick in our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN guide</a>, and this promotion also appears in our running list of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN deals</a>.

We measured average download speeds at 88 percent of our unprotected connection and upload speeds at 98 percent, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming and torrenting. It also unblocked Netflix in every region we tested, and while its Mac and iOS apps aren’t quite as polished as the Windows and Android versions, the service is still easy to install and largely set-it-and-forget-it across platforms. We gave Proton VPN a score of 90 out of 100.</p><p>Proton VPN Plus is the company’s premium tier and includes access to its full server network, which now spans more than 15,000 servers across 120-plus countries. A single subscription covers up to 10 devices at once and unlocks features like NetShield ad and malware blocking, Secure Core “double hop” connections, split tunneling, custom DNS controls and priority customer support.

Even the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs</a> can be used to conceal crimes and make the perpetrators harder to track. Fortunately, most of the world's governments (at least for now) recognize that VPNs are just technology that can be used for good or ill.</p><p>That means VPNs are legal in almost every country in the world. The countries that do restrict VPNs tend to be those where internet freedoms are already curtailed, like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. There are distinct gradations between those nations, though. And the days of worry-free VPN access elsewhere in the world is starting to show cracks: Currently free jurisdictions — including the UK, France and even several US states — are now considering bans.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-is-it-legal-to-use-a-vpn\"><strong>Is it legal to use a VPN?</strong></h2><p>The answer is almost always yes. In every country except the ones listed in the next section, there are no legal penalties for visiting a VPN website, downloading a VPN or connecting to a VPN server. </p><p>In the last few years, however, some countries that were once beacons of online liberty have started considering bans. This is part of a chain reaction that started with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html\" target=\"_blank\">age verification laws</a> for websites deemed harmful to children, most prominently the UK's Online Safety Act. Once everyone realized that anyone could <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html\" target=\"_blank\">circumvent the OSA</a> by using a VPN server in another country, UK politicians began <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/social-media-ban-under-16s-204516053.html\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">trying to ban VPNs as well</a>. The same thing is <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/france-might-seek-restrictions-on-vpn-use-in-campaign-to-keep-minors-off-social-media-205308716.html\" target=\"_blank\">currently happening in France</a>. In the US, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/wisconsin-vpn-bill-going-disaster-143305345.html\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Wisconsin</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/vpn-usage-at-risk-in-michigan-under-new-proposed-adult-content-law\" target=\"_blank\">Michigan</a> are both proposing age verification laws and VPN bans.</p><p>For now, though, none of these VPN bans have passed into law. Some have been defeated by the coordinated efforts of activists, including one <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/switzerland-will-revise-proposed-law-change-after-backlash-from-tech-industry\" target=\"_blank\">Swiss proposal</a> that would have forced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Proton VPN</a> to relocate.</p><p>In countries that do ban or restrict VPN usage, the laws can take several forms. Some countries have made all VPNs unlawful to use. Others only allow VPNs approved by the government — approval which usually comes from agreeing to share information with law enforcement. In some other countries, it's legal to use a VPN, but you'll face extra penalties if you use one to commit a crime. I'll go through all these categories in the next section.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-where-are-vpns-illegal\"><strong>Where are VPNs illegal?</strong></h2><p>This section is a complete list of countries where using a VPN is a legal risk. If a country isn't on this list, you can assume it's safe to use a VPN. Even nations with bad internet freedom scores, like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, often don't have anti-VPN laws to avoid scaring off international business.</p><p>One more important note is that anti-VPN laws are much more likely to be enforced against locals than foreigners. I'm not saying you should tempt fate, just noting that there are very few cases of a traveler being prosecuted in another country solely for using a VPN.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-countries-where-vpns-are-totally-banned\"><strong>Countries where VPNs are totally banned</strong></h3><p>VPNs are completely outlawed in four countries. Three of them — <strong>Belarus, Turkmenistan </strong>and <strong>North Korea </strong>— are isolated authoritarian regimes that restrict internet freedoms as part of nationwide crackdowns on all civil and political liberties. <strong>Iraq, </strong>while slightly more liberal overall, banned VPNs in 2014 in an attempt to kick the Islamic State off the internet. Twelve years later, the ban remains in place.</p><p><strong>Uganda </strong>is a special case. In 2018, the African nation enacted the world's first <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2018/7/1/uganda-introduces-social-media-tax-despite-criticism\" target=\"_blank\">social media tax</a>, which the government called necessary to raise funds but which was criticized as a backhanded assault on free speech. VPNs can get around the tax, so Ugandan internet service providers (ISPs) are required to block VPN traffic. However, there's no law on the books against using a VPN, so as long as you bring a service with obfuscation (like <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html\" target=\"_blank\">NordVPN</a>) you're good to go.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-countries-where-only-approved-vpns-are-allowed\"><strong>Countries where only approved VPNs are allowed</strong></h3><p>More common than banning VPNs altogether is restricting VPN usage to those approved by the government. This lets the powers that be grant limited VPN access to businesses for economic reasons, while also being able to yank it away as a method of control. It also means VPNs with a license to operate are likely to report data or install surveillance backdoors.</p><p>The nations that handle VPNs this way are <strong>China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Bahrain, Myanmar, Pakistan, India, Turkey</strong> and <strong>Oman</strong>. These countries don't ban all VPNs, but target popular providers with intermittent crackdowns and threats.</p><p>China in particular uses the so-called Great Firewall, the world's most sophisticated suite of censorship technologies, to prevent its citizens from even visiting the homepages of VPN companies. If you plan to travel in China and want to maintain access to the outside world, download a VPN before you go — and remember that using it while there will technically put you in violation of the law.</p><p>Russia is a textbook case of a selective VPN ban, with businesses allowed to use approved VPNs and everyone else left to scramble against periodic mass blocks. Turkey's autocratic government has also tried to crack down on VPN usage by blocking VPN sites, but clumsy implementation has left a lot of holes, allowing Instagram and other social media to remain a free speech lifeline for Turks.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-countries-with-extra-penalties-for-using-vpns-to-view-blocked-websites\"><strong>Countries with extra penalties for using VPNs to view blocked websites</strong></h3><p>In a few countries, it's legal to use any VPN, but against the law to use them for illegal activities. You might say, &quot;Duh, I'm aware that breaking the law is illegal,&quot; but there is a meaningful difference — some crimes are crimier than others. Just like you'll get a much harsher sentence if you rob someone with a weapon, you'll face steeper penalties for using a VPN to view content the government is trying to block. Countries that operate like this include <strong>Vietnam, Egypt </strong>and the <strong>UAE.</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-potential-future-vpn-bans\"><strong>Potential future VPN bans</strong></h2><p>Today, a number of countries once considered free and tolerant are proposing wide-ranging age verification laws, usually for reasons that boil down to &quot;think of the children!&quot; If enacted — as the UK’s Online Safety Act has shown — they effectively offer a choice between two equally unacceptable alternatives: Live with a censored version of the internet, or get broader access only once you sacrifice your online anonymity. </p><p>VPNs are the easiest and most direct workaround to this rising tide of censorship, which is why those same governments have them in their legislative crosshairs. The threat of enforcement chills free activity in a connected world where enforcers can't be everywhere at once.</p><p>For now, laws against VPN usage are still largely vague, inconsistent and unevenly applied. As citizens, we can work to make our voices heard and fight against these initiatives <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/lawmakers-want-ban-vpns-and-they-have-no-idea-what-theyre-doing\" target=\"_blank\">before they become law</a>. In the meantime, you may well want to get install your VPN of choice on as many devices as possible — and get your other <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html\" target=\"_blank\">cybersecurity ducks in a row</a> while you’re at it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-legal-170000878.html?src=rss",

All four apps are being rolled into ExpressVPN's existing <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-switches-to-multi-tiered-pricing-with-more-feature-options-130016633.html\" target=\"_blank\">multi-tiered pricing structure</a>.</p><p>ExpressKeys and ExpressMailGuard have officially launched and are now available to subscribers. Identity Defender launches for U.S. customers only on February 26. ExpressAI was originally planned to launch today, but ExpressVPN decided yesterday to hold it back in order to refine the experience. Its new launch date remains to be determined.</p><p>ExpressKeys and Identity Defender are based on existing products, but they're being relaunched for the new suite. ExpressKeys replaces ExpressVPN Keys, the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/best-password-manager-134639599.html\" target=\"_blank\">password manager</a> formerly controlled from the ExpressVPN app. By separating password management into its own app, ExpressVPN hopes to be able to update it more quickly without needing to ship a whole new version of the VPN. Everyone who currently has an Advanced or Pro subscription with ExpressVPN Keys will see it automatically replaced with ExpressKeys.</p><p>Identity Defender is only available in the United States, and so far only to users who created their accounts after October 28, 2024. Available for Advanced and Pro subscribers, Identity Defender consists of a data removal service, an identity theft insurance policy and a set of crawlers that scan for any suspicious activity around your personal information. Like ExpressKeys, it's transitioning from an integrated VPN feature to a standalone app.</p><p>ExpressMailGuard is a service for creating burner email addresses. If you're not comfortable handing over your real email address when creating a new account, you can use MailGuard to generate a fake address that forwards all email to your real inbox. If one of your aliases starts getting a lot of spam, you can cut off its access. It's managed through a separate dashboard that will be available to all ExpressVPN subscribers.</p><p>ExpressAI is an AI platform that saves all user-inputted data on strictly encrypted servers. It's apparently end-to-end encrypted, doesn't use your prompts to train its model and never saves uploads on persistent memory. It also has guardrails against processing harmful requests.</p><p>All these apps are in line with ExpressVPN's usual ethos. They're not innovations; all four can be easily compared to existing products. Instead, like the VPN itself — which rode this model to a spot on my <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN list</a> — they're focused on performing unsexy tasks well. The ability to bundle them with an ExpressVPN subscription should make them appealing to customers who are already fans of the core VPN product.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-launches-four-new-standalone-apps-140000686.html?src=rss",

With phones, tablets, laptops and wearables all competing for outlets, the right charger can make a difference in how quickly you get back to full power without worrying about overheating or long-term battery wear. Since many devices now ship without a power brick, choosing a charger with the right compatibility, ports and charging technology is just as important as raw speed.<br /><br />Today’s best fast chargers are designed to handle multiple devices at once, whether that’s a phone, laptop, AirPods or even an Apple Watch. Many models combine Type-C ports with a USB-A charger option to support older cables like a Lightning cable, while newer designs focus on multi-port chargers that can intelligently distribute power across everything you plug in. Brands like Anker continue to refine their designs, with compact options such as an Anker charger that’s easy to toss in a bag but powerful enough for everyday use.<br /><br />With so many wattages, port layouts and standards to consider, finding the best fast charger depends on how and where you charge. Whether you want a simple wall adapter, a travel-friendly option or a desktop hub built to power everything at once, this guide breaks down our top picks for 2026.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-fast-chargers-for-2026\">Best fast chargers for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-a-fast-charger\">What to consider before buying a fast charger</h2> \n<p>Before you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. This is especially true if you’re charging a mix of devices that still rely on a Lightning cable alongside newer USB-C gear.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>The reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery.</p> \n<p>For frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear.</p> \n<p>Finally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html\">OnePlus 13's</a> included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck speeds or contribute to overheating during fast charging.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-fast-charger-faqs\">Fast charger FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-gan\">What is GaN?</h3> \n<p>When looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages.</p> \n<p>Depending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-fast-chargers-affect-battery-life\">Do fast chargers affect battery life?</h3> \n<p>Technically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-fast-charger-and-a-regular-charger\">What's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger?</h3> \n<p>There isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be &quot;fast.&quot; That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",
