Several of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs</a> let you try them out without paying. A rare few, and only one on this list, let you try them without submitting payment information at all. Some VPNs have <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html\" target=\"_blank\">forever free plans</a> that let you use them indefinitely without paying, as long as you're OK with some limits.<br /><br />For the most part, though, your best chance to test a VPN for free is to pay for a subscription. Then, if you don't like the service, you can get your money back before the refund guarantee expires. This takes a bit more work, and some services have very tight turnarounds. However, it'll get you the most time with the most complete version of the VPN.<br /><br />With that out of the way, let's talk about the best VPN free trials for each definition of &quot;free trial.&quot; I'll start with VPNs that actually have free trials, most of which require a payment method and only work on mobile devices. The next section lists the best forever free plans. Finally, I'll share instructions for how to use a VPN money-back guarantee as a free trial.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-vpns-with-free-trials\"><strong>Best VPNs with free trials</strong></h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-vpn-forever-free-plans\"><strong>Best VPN forever free plans</strong></h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-using-vpn-money-back-guarantees-as-free-trials\"><strong>Using VPN money-back guarantees as free trials</strong></h2>\n<p>Although VPN free trials are great when you can get them, you'll enjoy a lot more flexibility by taking advantage of refund guarantees. Almost every provider has a money-back guarantee that doesn't require you to prove a specific problem. You'll probably have to deflect some upselling attempts before you actually get the refund, but most policies do promise you all your money back, with no pro-rating.</p>\n<p>I like to download VPNs on their one-month plans so I can put the full service through <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html\" target=\"_blank\">my usual battery of tests</a>. A 30-day money-back guarantee grants you enough time to learn whether you can use the VPN long-term. If you don't like the service, the standard method for getting a refund is to get in touch with customer support on the VPN provider's help page.</p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpns-with-free-trials-130000435.html?src=rss",

You’ll pay $72 upfront for 24 months of service, which amounts to 70 percent off the usual monthly rate and brings the long-term cost well below what many premium VPNs typically charge.</p><p>We’ve consistently been impressed by Proton VPN’s focus on privacy, its nonprofit ownership structure and the way it balances security features with strong real-world speeds. It’s a top pick in our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN guide</a>, and this promotion also appears in our running list of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN deals</a>.

We measured average download speeds at 88 percent of our unprotected connection and upload speeds at 98 percent, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming and torrenting. It also unblocked Netflix in every region we tested, and while its Mac and iOS apps aren’t quite as polished as the Windows and Android versions, the service is still easy to install and largely set-it-and-forget-it across platforms. We gave Proton VPN a score of 90 out of 100.</p><p>Proton VPN Plus is the company’s premium tier and includes access to its full server network, which now spans more than 15,000 servers across 120-plus countries. A single subscription covers up to 10 devices at once and unlocks features like NetShield ad and malware blocking, Secure Core “double hop” connections, split tunneling, custom DNS controls and priority customer support. Proton VPN Plus also supports fast P2P traffic on nearly all paid servers and includes VPN Accelerator, which helps maintain high speeds over long-distance connections.</p><p>Right now, Proton VPN Plus is discounted to $2.99 per month when you commit to two years, billed as $72 upfront for the first 24 months. After that, the plan renews annually at $83.88. That’s a 70 percent discount compared to the standard monthly rate. As with Proton’s other paid plans, the subscription comes with a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-proton-vpn-and-get-a-refund-170014128.html\" target=\"_blank\">30-day money-back guarantee</a>, so you can try it risk-free if you’re not ready to lock in long term.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-two-years-of-access-to-proton-vpn-for-70-percent-off-right-now-123000460.html?src=rss",

Even the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs</a> can be used to conceal crimes and make the perpetrators harder to track. Fortunately, most of the world's governments (at least for now) recognize that VPNs are just technology that can be used for good or ill.</p><p>That means VPNs are legal in almost every country in the world. The countries that do restrict VPNs tend to be those where internet freedoms are already curtailed, like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. There are distinct gradations between those nations, though. And the days of worry-free VPN access elsewhere in the world is starting to show cracks: Currently free jurisdictions — including the UK, France and even several US states — are now considering bans.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-is-it-legal-to-use-a-vpn\"><strong>Is it legal to use a VPN?</strong></h2><p>The answer is almost always yes. In every country except the ones listed in the next section, there are no legal penalties for visiting a VPN website, downloading a VPN or connecting to a VPN server. </p><p>In the last few years, however, some countries that were once beacons of online liberty have started considering bans. This is part of a chain reaction that started with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html\" target=\"_blank\">age verification laws</a> for websites deemed harmful to children, most prominently the UK's Online Safety Act. Once everyone realized that anyone could <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html\" target=\"_blank\">circumvent the OSA</a> by using a VPN server in another country, UK politicians began <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/social-media-ban-under-16s-204516053.html\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">trying to ban VPNs as well</a>. The same thing is <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/france-might-seek-restrictions-on-vpn-use-in-campaign-to-keep-minors-off-social-media-205308716.html\" target=\"_blank\">currently happening in France</a>. In the US, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/wisconsin-vpn-bill-going-disaster-143305345.html\" rel=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Wisconsin</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/vpn-usage-at-risk-in-michigan-under-new-proposed-adult-content-law\" target=\"_blank\">Michigan</a> are both proposing age verification laws and VPN bans.</p><p>For now, though, none of these VPN bans have passed into law. Some have been defeated by the coordinated efforts of activists, including one <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/switzerland-will-revise-proposed-law-change-after-backlash-from-tech-industry\" target=\"_blank\">Swiss proposal</a> that would have forced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Proton VPN</a> to relocate.</p><p>In countries that do ban or restrict VPN usage, the laws can take several forms. Some countries have made all VPNs unlawful to use. Others only allow VPNs approved by the government — approval which usually comes from agreeing to share information with law enforcement. In some other countries, it's legal to use a VPN, but you'll face extra penalties if you use one to commit a crime. I'll go through all these categories in the next section.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-where-are-vpns-illegal\"><strong>Where are VPNs illegal?</strong></h2><p>This section is a complete list of countries where using a VPN is a legal risk. If a country isn't on this list, you can assume it's safe to use a VPN. Even nations with bad internet freedom scores, like Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, often don't have anti-VPN laws to avoid scaring off international business.</p><p>One more important note is that anti-VPN laws are much more likely to be enforced against locals than foreigners. I'm not saying you should tempt fate, just noting that there are very few cases of a traveler being prosecuted in another country solely for using a VPN.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-countries-where-vpns-are-totally-banned\"><strong>Countries where VPNs are totally banned</strong></h3><p>VPNs are completely outlawed in four countries. Three of them — <strong>Belarus, Turkmenistan </strong>and <strong>North Korea </strong>— are isolated authoritarian regimes that restrict internet freedoms as part of nationwide crackdowns on all civil and political liberties. <strong>Iraq, </strong>while slightly more liberal overall, banned VPNs in 2014 in an attempt to kick the Islamic State off the internet. Twelve years later, the ban remains in place.</p><p><strong>Uganda </strong>is a special case. In 2018, the African nation enacted the world's first <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2018/7/1/uganda-introduces-social-media-tax-despite-criticism\" target=\"_blank\">social media tax</a>, which the government called necessary to raise funds but which was criticized as a backhanded assault on free speech. VPNs can get around the tax, so Ugandan internet service providers (ISPs) are required to block VPN traffic. However, there's no law on the books against using a VPN, so as long as you bring a service with obfuscation (like <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html\" target=\"_blank\">NordVPN</a>) you're good to go.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-countries-where-only-approved-vpns-are-allowed\"><strong>Countries where only approved VPNs are allowed</strong></h3><p>More common than banning VPNs altogether is restricting VPN usage to those approved by the government. This lets the powers that be grant limited VPN access to businesses for economic reasons, while also being able to yank it away as a method of control. It also means VPNs with a license to operate are likely to report data or install surveillance backdoors.</p><p>The nations that handle VPNs this way are <strong>China, Russia, Iran, Venezuela, Bahrain, Myanmar, Pakistan, India, Turkey</strong> and <strong>Oman</strong>. These countries don't ban all VPNs, but target popular providers with intermittent crackdowns and threats.</p><p>China in particular uses the so-called Great Firewall, the world's most sophisticated suite of censorship technologies, to prevent its citizens from even visiting the homepages of VPN companies. If you plan to travel in China and want to maintain access to the outside world, download a VPN before you go — and remember that using it while there will technically put you in violation of the law.</p><p>Russia is a textbook case of a selective VPN ban, with businesses allowed to use approved VPNs and everyone else left to scramble against periodic mass blocks. Turkey's autocratic government has also tried to crack down on VPN usage by blocking VPN sites, but clumsy implementation has left a lot of holes, allowing Instagram and other social media to remain a free speech lifeline for Turks.</p><h3 id=\"jump-link-countries-with-extra-penalties-for-using-vpns-to-view-blocked-websites\"><strong>Countries with extra penalties for using VPNs to view blocked websites</strong></h3><p>In a few countries, it's legal to use any VPN, but against the law to use them for illegal activities. You might say, &quot;Duh, I'm aware that breaking the law is illegal,&quot; but there is a meaningful difference — some crimes are crimier than others. Just like you'll get a much harsher sentence if you rob someone with a weapon, you'll face steeper penalties for using a VPN to view content the government is trying to block. Countries that operate like this include <strong>Vietnam, Egypt </strong>and the <strong>UAE.</strong>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-potential-future-vpn-bans\"><strong>Potential future VPN bans</strong></h2><p>Today, a number of countries once considered free and tolerant are proposing wide-ranging age verification laws, usually for reasons that boil down to &quot;think of the children!&quot; If enacted — as the UK’s Online Safety Act has shown — they effectively offer a choice between two equally unacceptable alternatives: Live with a censored version of the internet, or get broader access only once you sacrifice your online anonymity. </p><p>VPNs are the easiest and most direct workaround to this rising tide of censorship, which is why those same governments have them in their legislative crosshairs. The threat of enforcement chills free activity in a connected world where enforcers can't be everywhere at once.</p><p>For now, laws against VPN usage are still largely vague, inconsistent and unevenly applied. As citizens, we can work to make our voices heard and fight against these initiatives <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/11/lawmakers-want-ban-vpns-and-they-have-no-idea-what-theyre-doing\" target=\"_blank\">before they become law</a>. In the meantime, you may well want to get install your VPN of choice on as many devices as possible — and get your other <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/12-steps-you-can-take-right-now-to-be-safer-online-130008335.html\" target=\"_blank\">cybersecurity ducks in a row</a> while you’re at it.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/are-vpns-legal-170000878.html?src=rss",

All four apps are being rolled into ExpressVPN's existing <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-switches-to-multi-tiered-pricing-with-more-feature-options-130016633.html\" target=\"_blank\">multi-tiered pricing structure</a>.</p><p>ExpressKeys and ExpressMailGuard have officially launched and are now available to subscribers. Identity Defender launches for U.S. customers only on February 26. ExpressAI was originally planned to launch today, but ExpressVPN decided yesterday to hold it back in order to refine the experience. Its new launch date remains to be determined.</p><p>ExpressKeys and Identity Defender are based on existing products, but they're being relaunched for the new suite. ExpressKeys replaces ExpressVPN Keys, the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/best-password-manager-134639599.html\" target=\"_blank\">password manager</a> formerly controlled from the ExpressVPN app. By separating password management into its own app, ExpressVPN hopes to be able to update it more quickly without needing to ship a whole new version of the VPN. Everyone who currently has an Advanced or Pro subscription with ExpressVPN Keys will see it automatically replaced with ExpressKeys.</p><p>Identity Defender is only available in the United States, and so far only to users who created their accounts after October 28, 2024. Available for Advanced and Pro subscribers, Identity Defender consists of a data removal service, an identity theft insurance policy and a set of crawlers that scan for any suspicious activity around your personal information. Like ExpressKeys, it's transitioning from an integrated VPN feature to a standalone app.</p><p>ExpressMailGuard is a service for creating burner email addresses. If you're not comfortable handing over your real email address when creating a new account, you can use MailGuard to generate a fake address that forwards all email to your real inbox. If one of your aliases starts getting a lot of spam, you can cut off its access. It's managed through a separate dashboard that will be available to all ExpressVPN subscribers.</p><p>ExpressAI is an AI platform that saves all user-inputted data on strictly encrypted servers. It's apparently end-to-end encrypted, doesn't use your prompts to train its model and never saves uploads on persistent memory. It also has guardrails against processing harmful requests.</p><p>All these apps are in line with ExpressVPN's usual ethos. They're not innovations; all four can be easily compared to existing products. Instead, like the VPN itself — which rode this model to a spot on my <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN list</a> — they're focused on performing unsexy tasks well. The ability to bundle them with an ExpressVPN subscription should make them appealing to customers who are already fans of the core VPN product.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-launches-four-new-standalone-apps-140000686.html?src=rss",

With phones, tablets, laptops and wearables all competing for outlets, the right charger can make a difference in how quickly you get back to full power without worrying about overheating or long-term battery wear. Since many devices now ship without a power brick, choosing a charger with the right compatibility, ports and charging technology is just as important as raw speed.<br /><br />Today’s best fast chargers are designed to handle multiple devices at once, whether that’s a phone, laptop, AirPods or even an Apple Watch. Many models combine Type-C ports with a USB-A charger option to support older cables like a Lightning cable, while newer designs focus on multi-port chargers that can intelligently distribute power across everything you plug in. Brands like Anker continue to refine their designs, with compact options such as an Anker charger that’s easy to toss in a bag but powerful enough for everyday use.<br /><br />With so many wattages, port layouts and standards to consider, finding the best fast charger depends on how and where you charge. Whether you want a simple wall adapter, a travel-friendly option or a desktop hub built to power everything at once, this guide breaks down our top picks for 2026.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-fast-chargers-for-2026\">Best fast chargers for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-consider-before-buying-a-fast-charger\">What to consider before buying a fast charger</h2> \n<p>Before you start looking at specific chargers, it's critical to determine three things: how many devices do you need to charge, how much power do they require and whether or not you're planning on traveling with any of them. This is especially true if you’re charging a mix of devices that still rely on a Lightning cable alongside newer USB-C gear.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>The reason for the first question is simple. If you only need to charge a single device, like an iPhone or Android phone, it's cheaper and usually more space-efficient to get a lower-wattage phone charger with one port instead of two or three. Next, it's critical to figure out how much electricity your gadgets need because it doesn't make sense to buy a power brick that pushes out more juice than your device can actually use. This may sound a bit tricky, but most major manufacturers will list a product's max charging speeds in its tech specs, which is typically denoted by a specific wattage (15W, for example) or a quick-charge rating.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, very powerful or large laptops like gaming notebooks can suck a ton of juice (more than 140 watts), which means they may rely on more traditional power adapters with barrel plugs. This may result in them not being compatible with universal chargers. Some of these PCs may also support charging over USB-C, so even if a specific adapter can't deliver its full power draw, it can still send over some energy — but it will do so at a slower rate compared to the laptop's included charger. To get the best performance, using a fast charging cable, such as a USB-C cable, can make a big difference in maintaining consistent power delivery.</p> \n<p>For frequent travelers, size and weight are often important considerations, because the bigger and heavier a charger is, the more annoying it will be to lug around. You'll also want to think about other factors like support for international plugs, which can be a big help to anyone who regularly visits other countries. If you’re already traveling with power banks or a charging station, choosing a compact GaN charger can help streamline your gear.</p> \n<p>Finally, you'll want to figure out if your smartphone uses a proprietary charging standard or if it's compatible with the USB Power Delivery spec (USB PD). For example, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/oneplus-13-review-a-focused-flagship-that-ignores-the-ai-hype-140013418.html\">OnePlus 13's</a> included SuperVOOC power adapter can send up to 100 watts to the phone. However, if you use a generic USB-PD charger, speeds top out at 45 watts. That’s still pretty quick, but not nearly as fast as OnePlus' brick — and the same applies to devices with super fast charging support. Also, make sure your charging cable and connector are up to spec, as lower-quality accessories can bottleneck speeds or contribute to overheating during fast charging.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-fast-charger-faqs\">Fast charger FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-gan\">What is GaN?</h3> \n<p>When looking for chargers, you may notice that some are marked as GaN, which stands for gallium nitride. This is an important distinction because, when compared to older adapters that use silicon switches, GaN-based devices support increased power efficiency and output, allowing manufacturers to create more compact bricks that run cooler and support higher wattages.</p> \n<p>Depending on the specific power output, GaN adapters can be 30 to 50 percent smaller and lighter than silicon-based alternatives. That might not sound like much, but when they’re sitting in a bag alongside a laptop and a half dozen other accessories you might have, cutting down on excess bulk and weight goes a long way.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-fast-chargers-affect-battery-life\">Do fast chargers affect battery life?</h3> \n<p>Technically yes, because the process of sending a ton of watts into a gadget and potentially generating additional heat while doing so can decrease battery health over time. That said, modern devices and chargers use various protocols to ensure temperatures and power levels stay within preset limits — in large part to avoid damaging the product or creating a safety risk. At a base level, simply charging a gadget regardless of speed will cause degradation over time (nothing stays perfect forever, you know?). So as long as you use compatible chargers and cables, the impact of fast charging is generally quite negligible.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-difference-between-a-fast-charger-and-a-regular-charger\">What's the difference between a fast charger and a regular charger?</h3> \n<p>There isn't a single generally accepted definition of fast charging. However, with power adapters capable of sending as little as five watts or less, it's important to know how much juice your device is getting, especially if you need to recharge something quickly. So depending on who you ask (particularly when it comes to smartphones), any charger that can push out more than 15 to 18 watts is generally considered to be &quot;fast.&quot; That said, with some phones capable of receiving more than 100 watts and up to 240 watts for some laptops, it's more important than ever to consider what devices you own before buying a new fast charger.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-fast-chargers-140011033.html?src=rss",

At its best, it’s just a good-looking screen that can be set up quickly that reliably shows the photos you care about. Unfortunately, that’s not always how things play out. The market is flooded with cheap digital frames that promise simplicity but end up delivering washed-out displays, clunky apps and a frustrating experience — leading you to abandon it after a week.<br /><br />That’s a shame, because a good digital frame can be really enjoyable. Most of us have thousands of photos sitting on our phones that never make it beyond the camera roll, even though they’re exactly the kind of moments worth seeing every day. A solid frame gives those images a permanent home, whether it’s family photos cycling in the living room or shared albums updating automatically for relatives across the country. We’ve tested a range of smart photo frames to separate the genuinely useful options from the forgettable junk, and these are the ones that are actually worth putting on display.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-digital-picture-frames-for-2026\">Best digital picture frames for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-digital-picture-frames\">What to look for in digital picture frames</h2> \n<p>While a digital photo frame feels like a simple piece of tech, there are a number of things I considered when trying to find one worth displaying in my home. First and foremost was screen resolution and size. I was surprised to learn that most digital photo frames have a resolution around 1,200 x 800, which feels positively pixelated. (That's for frames with screen sizes in the nine- to ten-inch range, which is primarily what I considered for this guide.)</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>But after trying a bunch of frames, I realized that screen resolution is not the most important factor; my favorite photos looked best on frames that excelled in reflectivity, brightness, viewing angles and color temperature. A lot of these digital photo frames were lacking in one or more of these factors; they often didn't deal with reflections well or had poor viewing angles.</p> \n<p>A lot of frames I tested felt cheap and looked ugly as well, which isn’t something you want in a smart device that sits openly in your home. That includes lousy stands, overly glossy plastic parts and design decisions I can only describe as strange, particularly for items that are meant to just blend into your home. The best digital photo frames don't call attention to themselves and look like an actual “dumb” frame, so much so that those that aren’t so tech-savvy might mistake them for one.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most important thing outside of the display, though, is the software. Let me be blunt: a number of frames I tested had absolutely atrocious companion apps and software experiences that I would not wish on anyone. One that I tried did not have a touchscreen, but did have an IR remote (yes, like the one you controlled your TV with 30 years ago). Trying to use that with a Wi-Fi connection was painful, and when I tried instead to use a QR code, I was linked to a Google search for random numbers instead of an actual app or website. I gave up on that frame, the $140 PixStar, on the spot.</p> \n<p>Other things were more forgivable. A lot of the frames out there are basically Android tablets with a bit of custom software slapped on the top, which worked fine but wasn't terribly elegant. And having to interact with the photo frame via touch wasn't great because you end up with fingerprints all over the display. The best frames I tried were smart about what features you could control on the frame itself vs. through an app, the latter of which is my preferred method.</p> \n<p>Another important software note: many frames I tried require subscriptions for features that absolutely should be included out of the box. For example, one frame would only let me upload 10 photos at a time without a subscription. Others would let you link a Google Photos account, but you could only sync a single album without paying up. Yet another option didn't let you create albums to organize the photos that were on the frame — it was just a giant scroll of photos with no way to give them order.</p> \n<p>While some premium frames offer perks like unlimited photos or cloud storage, they often come at a cost. I can understand why certain things might go under a subscription, like if you're getting a large amount of cloud storage, for example. But these subscriptions feel like ways for companies to make recurring revenue from a product made so cheaply they can't make any money on the frame itself. I'd urge you to make sure your chosen frame doesn't require a subscription (neither of the frames I recommend in this guide need a subscription for any of their features), especially if you plan on giving this device as a gift to loved ones.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-should-you-spend-on-a-digital-picture-frame\">How much should you spend on a digital picture frame</h2> \n<p>For a frame with a nine- or ten-inch display, expect to spend at least $100. Our budget recommendation is $99, and all of the options I tried that were cheaper were not nearly good enough to recommend. Spending $150 to $180 will get you a significantly nicer experience in all facets, from functionality to design to screen quality.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-digital-frames-faqs\">Digital frames FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-are-digital-photo-frames-a-good-idea\">Are digital photo frames a good idea?</h3> \n<p>Yes, as long as you know what to expect. A digital picture frame makes it easy to enjoy your favorite shots without printing them. They’re especially nice for families who want to display new photos quickly. The key is understanding the limitations. Some frames have lower resolution displays or need a constant Wi-Fi connection to work properly, so they’re not a perfect replacement for a high-quality print on the wall. But if you want a simple way to keep memories on display and up to date, they’re a solid choice.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-you-upload-photos-to-a-digital-frame-from-anywhere\">Can you upload photos to a digital frame from anywhere?</h3> \n<p>Most modern digital frames let you do this, but it depends on the model. Many connect to Wi-Fi and use apps, cloud storage or email uploads, so you can add photos from your phone no matter where you are. Some even let family members share directly, which is great for keeping grandparents updated with new pictures. That said, a few budget models only work with USB drives or memory cards, so check how the frame handles uploads before buying.</p> \n<p><em>Georgie Peru contributed to this report.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-digital-frame-120046051.html?src=rss",

Its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $88 for two years, plus four additional free months. The Basic plan is where you'll see the biggest discount: it's $68 for two years, plus the same four additional free months.</p> \n<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html\">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> \n<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-deal-two-year-plans-are-up-to-81-percent-off-180602860.html?src=rss",

Setup is quick, requires no tools and takes just a minute or two as long as you have a compatible iPhone or iPad. Once paired, your AirTag quietly works in the background to help you locate misplaced belongings. This guide walks through how to set up an AirTag, how to name it so you can easily identify what it’s attached to and what to do if setup doesn’t go as planned.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-you-need-before-setting-up-an-airtag\">What you need before setting up an AirTag</h2><p>Before you begin, make sure you have the following:</p><ul><li><p>An iPhone or iPad signed in to your Apple Account</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth enabled on that device</p></li><li><p>Location Services enabled</p></li><li><p>iOS or iPadOS 14.5 or later (AirTag 2nd generation requires iOS or iPadOS 26.2.1 or later)</p></li><li><p>A stable Wi-Fi or cellular connection</p></li></ul><p>You’ll also want to ensure iCloud Keychain is enabled and that your Apple Account setup is fully completed in Settings.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-set-up-an-airtag-using-your-iphone-or-ipad\">How to set up an AirTag using your iPhone or iPad</h2><p>The easiest way to set up an AirTag is directly through the on-screen setup prompt.</p><ol><li><p>Remove the plastic tab from your <strong>AirTag </strong>to activate the battery.</p></li><li><p>Hold the <strong>AirTag </strong>near your unlocked iPhone or iPad.</p></li><li><p>When the setup animation appears, tap <strong>Connect</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Choose a category for your <strong>AirTag</strong>, such as Keys, Backpack or Luggage.

If you’re setting up multiple AirTags, make sure only one is near your device at a time. If more than one is detected, a notification will appear saying “More than one AirTag detected”. If this happens, move the others farther away and try again.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-add-an-airtag-using-the-find-my-app\">How to add an AirTag using the Find My app</h2><p>If the setup animation doesn’t appear automatically, you can add an AirTag manually through Find My.</p><ol><li><p>Open the <strong>Find My</strong> app on your iPhone or iPad.</p></li><li><p>Tap the <strong>Items </strong>tab.</p></li><li><p>Tap the <strong>Add </strong>button.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>Add AirTag</strong> or <strong>Other Item </strong>(if you’re adding a compatible FindMy Network accessory).</p></li><li><p>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup.</p></li></ol><p>You can add up to 32 items in Find My, including AirTags, shared items and compatible accessories.

Two years after <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-lays-off-hundreds-of-employees-in-its-assistant-hardware-and-other-divisions-082540416.html\" target=\"_blank\">leaving Google</a>, James Park and Eric Friedman announced a new platform that shifts the focus from the individual to the family. They say the Luffu mobile app &quot;uses AI quietly in the background&quot; to collect and organize family health information.</p><p>&quot;At Fitbit, we focused on personal health — but after Fitbit, health for me became bigger than just thinking about myself,&quot; Park <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/from-the-founders-of-fitbit-introducing-luffu-your-guardian-for-family-health--safety-302676975.html\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a press release. The app is particularly focused on the &quot;CEO of the family&quot; —  the person who manages appointments, prescriptions and other health-related tasks.</p><p>But the definition of family isn't limited to parents raising children. The company sees its tool as especially valuable for caregivers in their 40s and 50s who may be managing the needs of both aging parents and kids. It even tracks pets' health habits.</p><p>&quot;We're managing care across three generations — kids at home, busy parents in the middle, and my dad in his 80s who's living with diabetes and still wants to stay fiercely independent,&quot; Friedman wrote. &quot;And the moments that matter most are often the most chaotic: a late-night fever, a sudden urgent care visit, a doctor asking questions you can't answer quickly because the details are scattered.&quot;</p><figure><img alt=\"Screenshot from the Luffu app. &quot;Family morning brief&quot; summarizes everyone's health habits.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/luffu.jpg\" style=\"height: 720px; width: 1200px;\" /><figcaption>The app's AI includes a Morning Brief that recaps everyone's health.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Luffu</div></figure><p>The company claims the app's AI &quot;isn't a chatbot layer.&quot; Rather, it serves as a &quot;guardian&quot; — proactively monitoring for changes silently in the background. The AI then provides insights and triggers alerts when something is out of whack. You can also ask the app health data questions using plain language (so, there is some kind of chatbot) and share data with family members.</p><p>The company clearly wants to make entering data as easy as possible. Luffu allows family members to log info using voice, text or photos. It integrates with health platforms such as Apple Health and Fitbit. And the company eventually wants to expand into a hardware ecosystem — presumably, devices that make health data collection even easier.</p><p>Speaking of data collection, Luffu says, &quot;Users are always in control of exactly what is shared, with whom, and privacy and security are paramount for all family data.&quot; In addition, the company <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/03/fitbit-founders-ai-family-caregiving\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>Axios</em></a> that users can choose whether their data is used to train its AI. On the other hand, Big Tech has repeatedly shown that its most egregious data-collection practices are always wrapped in comforting language.
