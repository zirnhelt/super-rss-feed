      "content_html": "<img src=\"https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.engadget.com&sz=128\" style=\"width:100%;max-height:300px;object-fit:cover;\" />\n<p>Fitbit's founders have a new startup. Two years after <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-lays-off-hundreds-of-employees-in-its-assistant-hardware-and-other-divisions-082540416.html\" target=\"_blank\">leaving Google</a>, James Park and Eric Friedman announced a new platform that shifts the focus from the individual to the family. They say the Luffu mobile app &quot;uses AI quietly in the background&quot; to collect and organize family health information.</p><p>&quot;At Fitbit, we focused on personal health — but after Fitbit, health for me became bigger than just thinking about myself,&quot; Park <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/from-the-founders-of-fitbit-introducing-luffu-your-guardian-for-family-health--safety-302676975.html\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a press release. The app is particularly focused on the &quot;CEO of the family&quot; —  the person who manages appointments, prescriptions and other health-related tasks.</p><p>But the definition of family isn't limited to parents raising children. The company sees its tool as especially valuable for caregivers in their 40s and 50s who may be managing the needs of both aging parents and kids. It even tracks pets' health habits.</p><p>&quot;We're managing care across three generations — kids at home, busy parents in the middle, and my dad in his 80s who's living with diabetes and still wants to stay fiercely independent,&quot; Friedman wrote. &quot;And the moments that matter most are often the most chaotic: a late-night fever, a sudden urgent care visit, a doctor asking questions you can't answer quickly because the details are scattered.&quot;</p><figure><img alt=\"Screenshot from the Luffu app. &quot;Family morning brief&quot; summarizes everyone's health habits.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/luffu.jpg\" style=\"height: 720px; width: 1200px;\" /><figcaption>The app's AI includes a Morning Brief that recaps everyone's health.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Luffu</div></figure><p>The company claims the app's AI &quot;isn't a chatbot layer.&quot; Rather, it serves as a &quot;guardian&quot; — proactively monitoring for changes silently in the background. The AI then provides insights and triggers alerts when something is out of whack. You can also ask the app health data questions using plain language (so, there is some kind of chatbot) and share data with family members.</p><p>The company clearly wants to make entering data as easy as possible. Luffu allows family members to log info using voice, text or photos. It integrates with health platforms such as Apple Health and Fitbit. And the company eventually wants to expand into a hardware ecosystem — presumably, devices that make health data collection even easier.</p><p>Speaking of data collection, Luffu says, &quot;Users are always in control of exactly what is shared, with whom, and privacy and security are paramount for all family data.&quot; In addition, the company <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/03/fitbit-founders-ai-family-caregiving\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>Axios</em></a> that users can choose whether their data is used to train its AI. On the other hand, Big Tech has repeatedly shown that its most egregious data-collection practices are always wrapped in comforting language. So, at the very least, I'd take their pitch with grains of salt and, most importantly, make sure each family member knows exactly what they're consenting to. After all, this is a for-profit company, and we don’t yet know its monetization strategy.</p><p>Luffu is currently taking waitlist sign-ups for a forthcoming limited public beta. You can learn more and sign up for the waitlist on the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.luffu.com/#about\" target=\"_blank\">company website</a>.</p><p><strong>Update, February 3, 2026, 1:14PM ET:</strong> This story has been updated to note that the Luffu public beta hasn’t started yet, but you can sign up for a waitlist to eventually get access when it starts.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/fitbit-founders-launch-luffu-a-way-to-integrate-your-familys-health-data-173251994.html?src=rss",
