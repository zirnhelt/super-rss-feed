Homeland Security asked the companies for names, email addresses, telephone numbers and any other identifying detail for accounts that have criticized the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or have reported the location of its agents. Google, Meta and Reddit have  complied with some of the requests</p><p>Administrative subpoenas are different from warrants and are issued by the DHS. <em>The Times</em> says they were rarely used in the past and were mostly sent to companies for the investigation of serious crimes, such as child trafficking. Apparently, though, the government has ramped up its use in the past year. “It’s a whole other level of frequency and lack of accountability,” Steve Loney, a senior supervising attorney for ACLU, told the publication. </p><p>Companies can choose whether to comply with the authorities or not, and some of them give the subject of a subpoena up to 14 days to fight it in court. Google told <em>The Times</em> that its review process for government requests is “ designed to protect user privacy while meeting [its] legal obligations” and that it informs users when their accounts have been subpoenaed unless it has been legally ordered not to or in exceptional circumstances. “We review every legal demand and push back against those that are overbroad,” the company said. </p><p>Some of the accounts that were subpoenaed belong to users posting ICE activity in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Facebook and Instagram in English and Spanish. The DHS asked Meta for their names and details on September 11, and the users were notified about it on October 3. They were told that if Meta didn’t receive documentation that they were fighting the subpoena in court within 10 days, Meta will give Homeland Security the information it was asking for. The ACLU filed a motion for the users in court, arguing that the DHS is using administrative subpoenas as a tool to suppress speech of people it didn’t agree with. </p><p>In late January, Meta started <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-blocks-links-to-ice-list-a-wiki-that-names-agents-231410653.html\" target=\"_blank\">blocking links to ICE List</a>, a website that lists thousands of ICE and Border Patrol agents’ names.

A whole bunch of compelling games arrived this week, and Sony dropped some news about more that are on the way to PS5 and other platforms during its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-watch-playstations-hour-long-state-of-play-and-what-to-expect-162128585.html\" target=\"_blank\">State of Play stream on Thursday</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>For one thing, I didn’t have a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-neva-prequel-is-arriving-next-week-081239628.html\" target=\"_blank\">prequel for <em>Neva</em></a>, one of my favorite games of the last few years on my bingo card. I’m very much looking forward to checking out that DLC next week.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>It’s really neat that Motion Twin and Evil Empire — the studios behind <em>Dead Cells</em> and its expansions, respectively — are getting to make a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dead-cells-castlevania-dlc-trailer-release-window-012349322.html\" target=\"_blank\">proper Castlevania game</a>. While it might not be developing many games in-house anymore, giving external studios the chance to run with its franchises is a very smart move on Konami’s part. Not least because we’re getting a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/silent-hill-townfall-takes-the-series-trademark-fog-to-an-eerie-coastal-community-233324897.html\" target=\"_blank\">Silent Hill game set in Scotland as well</a>.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>I’ve had<em> Big Walk</em> on my radar since the game was first shown off <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-walk-is-the-next-project-from-the-untitled-goose-game-team-014503842.html\" target=\"_blank\">at The Game Awards a couple of years back</a>. This is a co-op multiplayer game from <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> studio House House and publisher Panic in which you'll go on adventures with your friends and help each other through puzzles and other challenges using voice, text chat and gestures. You can just hang out with your buds and watch the sunset or put their binoculars into the ocean too.</p><p>Expect <em>Big Walk</em> to arrive later this year on PS5 (including as a Monthly Game for all PS Plus members), Steam and Epic Games Store. There will be support for cross-platform play between PS5 and PC.</p><p>Also, Remedy Entertainment is technically an indie studio. As such, I can mention here that I cannot wait for <em>Control Resonant</em>, which is probably going to break my brain with all the perspective shifting Remedy showed off in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-first-control-resonant-gameplay-trailer-shows-dylan-defying-physics-in-a-sideways-nyc-224746545.html\" target=\"_blank\">the gameplay trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-new-releases\">New releases</h2><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>As with any successful heist, planning and execution are equally paramount in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rescue-african-artifacts-from-colonizers-museums-in-the-heist-game-relooted-000035161.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Relooted</em></a>. Setting things up properly before hightailing it out of a museum with artifacts reminds me a bit of <em>Teardown</em> albeit without all the voxel destruction. But <em>Relooted</em> is a lot more than that.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an anti-colonialist story in which parkour enthusiast Nomali and her crew take back African artifacts (all of which exist in real life) from Western museums. I did encounter some performance issues while playing on PC, but that didn't take too much away from the enjoyable, in-the-moment action and having to adjust escape routes on the fly when things go awry. Nor did the framerate drops detract one bit from the important story that South African studio Nyamakop is telling here.</p><p><em>Relooted </em>is out now on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/relooted-89fdd7\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Store</a> and <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6ffef56b-cf61-4e51-b729-b51fe5f828a9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9yZWxvb3RlZC85cHBwNTM0NGIzbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZmZmVmNTZiLWNmNjEtNGU1MS1iNzI5LWI1MWZlNWY4MjhhOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvcmVsb290ZWQvOXBwcDUzNDRiM2xzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUVLf7VY__JniAzAb0NzQAwzjMV2IK4G3SSylF-wCMTp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Frelooted%2F9ppp5344b3ls\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Series X/S</a>.

It was initially announced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-16-latest-mew-genics-teaser-collects-trinkets-with-magic-propertie.html\" target=\"_blank\">in 2012</a> when co-developer Edmund McMillen was still part of <em>Super Meat Boy </em>studio Team Meat. After years of <em>Mewgenics </em>being in development hell amid McMillen focusing on projects such as <em>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</em>, he's finally seen the game through with the help of longtime collaborator Tyler Glaiel.</p><p>This is a turn-based strategy roguelike in which players breed cats and then take kitties with wild mutations and blends of powers into combat. There's a lot to explore and discover here. McMillen and Glaiel claim the main campaign runs for over 200 hours. Having more than 10&nbsp;character classes (each with 75 unique abilities), more than 900 items and hundreds of bosses and enemies could well ensure that things stay fresh enough to justify that run time.</p><p>Reviews have largely been positive for this one, though the humor didn't click for some critics. <em>Mewgenics </em>is out now on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>. It usually costs $30, but you can save $3 if you buy it by February 24.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>Rogue Point </em>is a co-op shooter for up to four players that’s worth paying attention to, in large part because it’s from the team behind <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-black-mesa-the-fan-made-half-life-remake-finally-has-a-rel.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Black Mesa</em></a>, the fan remake of <em>Half-Life</em>. It's now available in early access on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>, typically for $20, though there's a 15 percent discount until February 26.</p><p>This appears to be in the vein of tactical shooters like Ubisoft's Tom Clancy games. There are objective-based missions and a Counter-Strike-style economy for unlocking and upgrading gear. While there are only four maps as things stand, Crowbar Collective has implemented a system that randomizes the layouts to keep things fresh.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-upcoming\">Upcoming&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Steam Next Fest is almost upon us. Many developers and publishers are preparing to release demos for their games, but some are arriving ahead of the event, such as one for <em>Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!</em> The demo is a blast and it feels like the kind of retro <em>Starship Troopers</em> shooter I wish we'd had in the late '90s.&nbsp;</p><p>I really enjoy <em>Helldivers 2</em>, which takes a lot of inspiration from <em>Starship Troopers</em>. In turn, this game draws from <em>Helldivers 2</em>, with features like tossing a flare to tell a support craft to send gear down to the planet's surface. I just wish the mech was a bit more fun and effective to use.</p><p>If you would like to know more about this game from <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em> developer Auroch Digital and publisher Dotemu, you can check out the demo on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4307720/Starship_Troopers_Ultimate_Bug_War__Demo/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>. <em>Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War! </em>is coming to Steam, GOG, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 16.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>A demo for a line-based puzzle title called <em>Rope </em>popped up on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4329270/Rope_Demo/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> this week ahead of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3866170/Rope/\" target=\"_blank\">full game's arrival</a> in April for about $3.50. The aim is to connect ropes of the same color to clear them. More rules will be introduced over time to make the game more challenging.</p><p>While <em>Rope</em> looks charming enough, I mainly wanted to include it in this week’s roundup because I thought developer Ikuo's comments in the press release were quite lovely.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;My games are neither flashy nor extravagant. Instead, I focus on preserving the essence of play. Like hide‑and‑seek or tag — simple rules that draw you in until you forget the time,&quot; Ikuo said. &quot;<em>Rope </em>brings that timeless spirit of play into a modern puzzle game. It is intuitive, endlessly replayable and quietly absorbing. I aimed to create a small, understated experience that stays with players long after they put it down. I hope this game leaves even a small impression on someone’s heart.&quot;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>The Mermaid Mask </em>is a project that SFB Games put on the backburner after another one of their games became a hit (that would be <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/crow-country-is-a-darkly-meditative-callback-to-survival-horrors-past-130041405.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Crow Country</em></a>, which was one of our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-games-of-the-year-2024-133005519.html\" target=\"_blank\">favorite games of 2024</a>). </p><p>This point-and-click puzzle game is the latest installment in the long-running Detective Grimoire series<em>.&nbsp;</em>A teaser trailer doesn't give away too much, but I do enjoy what we see of the hand-drawn 2D animation here. </p><p>Here's hoping this is a worthy follow-up to <em>Tangle Tower</em>, an Apple Arcade game <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-apple-arcade-best-games.html\" target=\"_blank\">we enjoyed very much</a>. We'll find out for sure when <em>The Mermaid Mask </em>lands on PC and consoles this summer. In the meantime, you can check out an updated demo that just hit <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1696770/The_Mermaid_Mask/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> ahead of Next Fest.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>The premise of<em> The Stairwell</em> is practically identical to that of <em>The Exit 8</em>. You walk through a small, contained scene multiple times. If everything looks okay, keep walking forward. If something is out of the ordinary, you turn around. Just try not to miss many anomalies. Rather than walk through corridors as in <em>The Exit 8</em> (the film adaptation of which <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlRQ1oatOt8\" target=\"_blank\">looks pretty promising</a>), <em>The Stairwell</em> sees you going up or down a seemingly infinite tower as you try to reach the goal.&nbsp;</p><p>This anomaly game, which is from Hidden Palace, has been on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3578120/The_Stairwell/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> since last year. It’s coming to PS5 on February 19. Expect jump scares.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Let's wrap things up for this week with an arcade game that requires just two inputs: one button to turn left, and another to veer right. You can't control the speed of your craft in <em>Ship v Maze</em>. All you can do to avoid crashing and ending your run is to react quickly enough to steer your ship through various obstacles. It's all about putting your reflexes to the test.</p><p><em>Ship v Maze </em>is from Cosmic Droplet (aka solo developer Frederic Vanmol), It'll hit <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113380/Ship_v_Maze/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> on April 2 for $4. A demo is available now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/relooted-reanimal-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000234.html?src=rss",

There are four available games to play, including <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n<p>These aren't new VR builds of the games, rather they are the versions previously released for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-26-nintendo-labo-review.html\">Nintendo Labo</a> VR set. This was a kit for the original Switch that allowed users to build a cardboard VR headset, among other items.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"cb0a072feed84ecc954d160d9d366b4f\"></div>\n<p>However, this is very good news for Switch 2 owners as Labo creations generally don't work with Nintendo's shiny new console. So this is the only way to experience the VR versions of the aforementioned four games. It's also worth noting that the Switch 2 upgrade for <em>Breath of the Wild</em> still includes the VR mode.</p>\n<p>There are some caveats. The Virtual Boy accessory is available to purchase as a hardware unit or in cardboard. The cardboard version is much cheaper, at $25, and is actually the preferred method for playing these games in VR.</p>\n<p>That's because the hardware version sits on a stand, like the original Virtual Boy, making it harder to move one's head around. The cardboard headset is free from those constraints. The hardware also includes red filters over the lenses, to better mimic the original experience, but these can be removed.</p>\n<p>However, the hardware version is better for playing actual Virtual Boy games, as they were designed for a static headset resting on a table. You'll have to decide if that trade-off is worth $100. It's also worth noting that Virtual Boy games <a href=\"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-clarifies-that-labo-vr-will-not-work-with-virtual-boy-for-switch-online\">will not work with the original Labo VR headset</a>, which is a bummer for OG Switch fans.</p>\n<div id=\"098320bb4af8469baa2f32343ef4b3c1\"></div>\n<p>Both versions of the Virtual Boy accessories <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-as-a-switch-and-switch-2-accessory-140037508.html\">will be available on February 17</a>, which is the same day several of the retro console's games head to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription service. They can be <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829\">purchased at the My Nintendo Store</a>. We got a chance to try the headset and came away fairly impressed, though noted that the revamped accessory is &quot;just as eccentric and ungainly as the original was three decades ago.&quot;</p>\n<p>For those wondering what all the fuss is about, the Virtual Boy was an actual console released by Nintendo all the way back in 1995. It was one of the first mass-market VR devices and, as such, was decades ahead of the curve. It was cumbersome, the games were only in red and there was nothing by way of motion control. Americans only got 14 games before the console was discontinued.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-virtual-boy-accessory-lets-you-play-vr-mario-and-zelda-on-switch-2-172138483.html?src=rss",

Its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $88 for two years, plus four additional free months. The Basic plan is where you'll see the biggest discount: it's $68 for two years, plus the same four additional free months.</p> \n<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html\">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> \n<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-deal-two-year-plans-are-up-to-81-percent-off-right-now-180602064.html?src=rss",

But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day. That’s where Apple’s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFH9BST&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b81fb587-99ff-4a0a-8491-b9b9460d3e9a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=iPhone+Air+MagSafe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjgxZmI1ODctOTlmZi00YTBhLTg0OTEtYjliOTQ2MGQzZTlhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1QiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR9o3Bk1eGEoY_MpvpdVaX8WwrXHv-kJY6NrXwaRfhTy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFH9BST\">iPhone Air MagSafe</a> battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

I understand that the pull of treating this social space just like other social spaces is strong, but we&#8217;re trying to do something different here&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ve updated and refreshed <a href=\"https://kottke.org/threads/guidelines\">the community guidelines</a>; if you are going to participate in comments threads here, I would appreciate you reading it. (Quick reminder: you need to be a <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members/\">KDO member</a> to comment.)</p>\n\t<p>Instead of going over the guidelines here, I thought it might be helpful to share some examples of what I would consider good comments &#038; threads:</p>\n\t<p>👏 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/12/the-lies-and-falsifications-of-oliver-sacks#cmt-13588\">Margaret M&#8217;s comment</a> on The Lies and Falsifications of Oliver Sacks (it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/12/the-lies-and-falsifications-of-oliver-sacks\">a good thread</a> in general); an excerpt:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a doctor. It&#8217;s my second career; I was a book editor before. Naturally, when I decided to go back to school to pursue medicine, I read all sorts of books by doctors about taking care of their patients. Obviously, I read everything he wrote (for a general audience, anyway).</p>\n\t<p>This is such a betrayal.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>🙌 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/01/core-memories-with-the-swiftie-dads#cmt-13739\">Stuart Kern&#8217;s comment</a> on Core Memories With the Swiftie Dads; an excerpt:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Got time for a lengthy Worst Dad Ever Goes to See Taylor Swift story?</p>\n\t<p>2018 Taylor Swift tour. I take joy in what brings either of my two daughters joy. Happy to take my 17 year old daughter to see Taylor Swift. It involved snakes for some reason.</p>\n\t<p>Months in advance she camps out online and scores two tickets. Days out she decorates a t-shirt. Concert day she gets home from school, paints her face. We sit in traffic for two hours to get to the stadium. She floats across the acres of parking lot, grooving on the scene. We get to the gate.</p>\n\t<p>&#8220;These tickets were for last night.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>👍 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/11/whats-all-the-fuss-about-pluribus\">Both discussions</a> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/12/are-we-still-loving-pluribus\">about Pluribus</a> — perfect posts for folks to express opinions. And so many people thoughtfully disagreeing with me and each other with kindness &#038; respect.</p>\n\t<p>😊 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/12/0048104-oh-this-is-devilisha-game\">The thread about the &#8220;devilish&#8221; 2025 game</a>. Quick comments work here — everyone understood the vibe of the thread.</p>\n\t<p>🎯 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/10/playing-boards-of-canada-on-a-dec-pdp-1-from-1959#cmt-12984\">Dalton&#8217;s comment</a> on Playing Boards of Canada on a DEC PDP-1 from 1959:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Somewhere there is a Venn diagram of all the things I like, and this is right in the middle of all of it!</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>It&#8217;s always OK to express your enthusiasm and appreciation for a link or comment.</p>\n\t<p>I also pulled some examples of feedback from social media that I don&#8217;t find helpful in contributing to a good discussion. None of these have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and_...\">&#8220;yes, and&#8230;&#8221;</a> vibe:</p>\n\t<p>👎 These replies to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cia-world-factbook-ratcliffe-trump-fbec61ce16c4b3db59db9cefce0da043\">the CIA deleting the World Factbook</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>But then, did we ever trust &#8220;facts&#8221; published by the CIA?</p></blockquote>\n\t<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m pretty sure half of them are functionally illiterate anyway so they probably don&#8217;t see the point.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Perfectly fine posts for social media but they wouldn&#8217;t work on KDO; they&#8217;re casually negative and don&#8217;t improve the conversation for others. Discussing the trustworthiness of the CIA, the propaganda aspect of the World Factbook, and the incompetence of the current regime are all worthy topics of discussion, but you&#8217;ve gotta work harder than these drive-by dunks.<sup id=\"fnref:1770947477\"><a href=\"https://kottke.org/#fn:1770947477\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\t<p>🤦‍♂️ This reply to <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/02/the-strangers-case\">The Strangers&#8217; Case</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Many would say that Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More were unoriginal. This same guidance is found from 1,600 years earlier in Luke 10. Many know is the parable of the Good Samaritan.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Again, very normal social media post. Further context/reading is good, but you can tell us about the Parable of the Good Samaritan without dinging Shakespeare for unoriginality.</p>\n\t<p>😱 This reply to <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/minute-maid-discontinuing-frozen-juice-9.7065520\">the news about canned juice being discontinued</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>OJ is liquid candy anyway, which is why juice sales are stalling. I just wish it weren&#8217;t towards the horrid paint thinner that is kombucha&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Self-explanatory, I hope.</p>\n\t<p>Anyway, I hope you get the gist and that I haven&#8217;t completely scared you off from commenting here. Really, the vast majority of comments here are great and I&#8217;m glad this facet of the site is back.</p>\n\t<ol><li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1770947477\">That said, the tone of <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/02/0048323-the-cia-has-deleted-the\">my post about the Factbook</a> was not at all positive or constructive: &#8220;The CIA has deleted the CIA World Factbook (a popular almanac about the countries of the world) from the web. Fuck this.

A four-pack of the first-gen Bluetooth trackers is on sale for $64, which is just about a record-low price (only $1 more). That's a 35 percent discount on the pack.</p> \n<p>Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag</a> down to about $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>If you use Apple devices and consider yourself to be a serial thing-misplacer, AirTags are extremely useful.

The studio worked with Dutch video game developer Nixxes Software, which Sony acquired in 2021 to help bring PlayStation games to PCs. The sequel to the first <em>Death Stranding</em> is set in Australia almost a year after the events of the original game. It still features a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by strange creatures, and you’ll still control Sam Porter Bridges to connect survivors in the continent to the chiral network communications system. </p><p>Kojima Production says the PC version of the game will come with a bunch of improvements, will work with NVIDIA, AMD and Intel Upscaler and FrameGen, and will have uncapped framerates. It will support 4K gaming and will come with support for ultrawide monitors with 21:9 aspect ratio, as well as for super ultrawidescreen monitors with 32:9 aspect ratio for PC. When it comes to audio, the PC version of the game supports 3D audio via Dolby Access and DTS Sound Unbound, as well as Windows Sonic for headphones. You can play using a mouse and a keyboard if you wish, but you can also play with a DualSense controller.</p><p>You’ll be able to pre-purchase<em> Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> starting today for $70 on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-pc-march-19/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> or <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-7773ec\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games</a> and receive extra in-game items.

Whether you’re replacing an older unit or trying one for the first time, these picks focus on appliances that are easy to live with and deliver crisp food without the need for deep frying.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-air-fryers-for-2026\">Best air fryers for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-does-an-air-fryer-do\">What does an air fryer do?</h2> \n<p>Let’s clear one thing up first: it’s not frying. Not really. Air fryers are more like smaller convection bake ovens, ones that are often pod-shaped. Most work by combining a heating element and fan, which means the hot air can usually better crisp the outside of food than other methods. They often reach higher top temperatures than toaster ovens – which is part of the appeal.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>For most recipes, a thin layer of oil (usually sprayed) helps to replicate that fried look and feel better. However, it will rarely taste precisely like the deep-fried or pan frying version when it comes out of the air fryer basket. Don’t let that put you off, though, because the air fryer, in its many forms, combines some of the best parts of other cooking processes and brings them together into an energy-efficient way of air fryer cooking dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-buying-guide-for-air-fryers\">Buying guide for air fryers</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-convection-ovens\">Convection ovens</h3> \n<p>You can separate most of these machines into two types of air fryers, and each has different pros and cons. Convection ovens are usually ovens with air fryer functions and features. They might have higher temperature settings to ensure that food crisps and cooks more like actually fried food. Most convection ovens are larger than dedicated air fryers, defeating some of the purpose of those looking to shrink cooking appliance surface area. Still, they are often more versatile with multiple cooking functions, and most have finer controls for temperatures, timings and even fan speed.</p> \n<p>You may never need a built-in oven if you have a decent convection oven. They often have the volume to handle roasts, entire chickens or tray bakes, and simply cook more, capacity-wise, making them more versatile than the pod-shaped competition.</p> \n<p>The flip side of that is that you’ll need counter space in the kitchen to house them. It also means you can use traditional oven accessories, like baking trays or cake tins, that you might already own.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-pod-shaped-air-fryers\">Pod-shaped air fryers</h3> \n<p>Pod-shaped air fryers are what you imagine when you think “air fryer.” They look like a cool, space-age kitchen gadget, bigger than a kettle but smaller than a toaster oven. Many use a drawer to hold ingredients while cooking, usually a mesh sheet or a more solid, non-stick tray with holes to allow the hot air to circulate. With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat and airflow to everything.</p> \n<p>That’s one of a few caveats. This type of air fryer typically doesn't have a window to see how things are cooking (with only a few exceptions), so you’ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. Basket-style air fryers also generally use less energy – there’s less space to heat – and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher.</p> \n<p>Some of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of tasty chicken wings or tenders while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries or veggies for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they’re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere.</p> \n<p>As mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you’ll have to pay for them.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/fcbb58a0-a9d4-11ec-97f7-1be0d263a8a8\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-air-fryer-pros-and-cons\">Air fryer pros and cons</h2> \n<p>Beyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you’ll be air frying, so even beginners can master these machines.</p> \n<p>One of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings, frozen foods and other delights with less fat than other methods like deep frying, which gets foods the crispiest. As air fryers work by circulating heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat and crisper food when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with vegetable oil. If you don’t, there’s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a dash of oil spray when you turn items during cooking.</p> \n<p>Most air fryers are easy to clean – especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We’ll get into cleaning guidance a little later.</p> \n<p>With a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient for cooking food than larger appliances like ovens. And if you don’t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable – especially the pod options.</p> \n<p>There are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest types of food – like chicken nuggets, frozen French fries or brussels sprouts. If you’re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can – and will – affect cooking.</p> \n<p>There’s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS – there’s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you’ll probably want to go for a large capacity air fryer – possibly one that has multiple cooking areas. You also might want to consider a different kitchen appliance, like a multicooker, sous vide or slow cooker to meet your specific cooking needs.</p> \n<p>You may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it’s cooked right through. If you’re planning to cook a whole chicken or a roast, please get a meat thermometer!</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-air-fryer-accessories\">Best air fryer accessories</h2> \n<p>Beyond official accessories from the manufacturer, try to pick up silicone-tipped tools. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B08RHQ5S95&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8dfb0e35-0d59-41ac-a6cd-b9af5a4bdad8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Tongs&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NpbGljb25lLU5vbi1TdGljay1SZXNpc3RhbnQtR3JpbGxpbmctVG9ydGlsbGFzL2RwL0IwOFJIUTVTOTU_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGRmYjBlMzUtMGQ1OS00MWFjLWE2Y2QtYjlhZjVhNGJkYWQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NpbGljb25lLU5vbi1TdGljay1SZXNpc3RhbnQtR3JpbGxpbmctVG9ydGlsbGFzL2RwL0IwOFJIUTVTOTUiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUPuXbF4SKrJD7HqCUdz2gVav2-m2vB7sAFn3UNnuwHn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSilicone-Non-Stick-Resistant-Grilling-Tortillas%2Fdp%2FB08RHQ5S95\">Tongs</a> are ideal, as is a silicon spatula to gently loosen food that might get stuck on the sides of the air fryer.

Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away the non-stick coating. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely.</p> \n<p>Remove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe – and you have a dishwasher – the job is pretty much done.</p> \n<p>Otherwise, hand wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any crumbs, greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us.</p> \n<p>Take a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers – use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides.</p> \n<p>If Dawn isn’t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn’t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-find-air-fryer-recipes\">How to find air fryer recipes</h2> \n<p>Beyond fries, nuggets and – a revelation – frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for air-fried foods. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however.</p> \n<p>Many of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there’s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words “air fryer” on the end of the search string. We’ve picked up some reliable options from <em>Delish</em>, which also has a handy air fryer time <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/cookware-reviews/a35686392/air-fryer-conversion/\">converter</a> for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes. <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/air-fryer-recipes\"><em>BBC Good Food</em></a> is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Nvb2tpbmcubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGZiMGUzNS0wZDU5LTQxYWMtYTZjZC1iOWFmNWE0YmRhZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQlYZaY4TNa78tVAt9mFUeOlSWHXXGjsrTSZXBwIMML9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcooking.nytimes.com%2F\">NYT Cooking</a>, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions. Aside from that, you can also grab plenty of cookbooks from your local bookshop with lots of recipes that you can use in your favorite air fryer.</p> \n<p>And if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What’s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake? We’re ready to try it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-air-fryers\">How we test air fryers</h2> \n<p>We put each air fryer we test through its paces by cooking a variety of foods in it including raw proteins like fish and chicken, raw vegetables like potatoes and cauliflower and frozen snacks like mozzarella sticks. We attempt to use each cooking method that the machine has pre-programmed, and when possible, follow a couple of recipes in any provided recipe booklets that come with the air fryer. We also clean the cooking basket and all other removable components as many times as possible, and will put those components into a dishwasher if they claim to be dishwasher-safe. We also make note of how loud the machine is when using different cooking settings and how warm the surrounding area becomes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss",

Now, at the tail end of that 20th anniversary celebration, Sony’s Santa Monica Studio has announced two new project. First, and most significantly, the original God of War trilogy from the PS2 and PS3 is being remade for the modern era. </p><p>There’s no footage of it yet — the developer says that they’re “very early in development,” so we likely won’t see or hear much about this for a while. But given renewed interest in God of War thanks to the excellent two Norse games from 2018 and 2022 (not to mention the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/ryan-hurst-cast-as-kratos-for-live-action-god-of-war-show-211655396.html\" target=\"_blank\">upcoming Amazon series</a>), it makes sense to revisit these classics. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>God of War</em> and <em>God of War II</em> were released for Playstation 2 in 2005 and 2007, respectively, while the third of the Greek trilogy hit PlayStation 3 in 2010. The third game was also remastered for the PS4. But it’s safe to say that while the first two games are classics for their era, they also really show their age in some gameplay spots. Hopefully the remake will smooth out those rough edges. (Who else has nightmares in the Hades level near the end of the first game? Not just me, right?)</p><p>While we won’t see the remakes for a while, there <em>is</em> a new God of War-inspired game out right now: <em>God of War Sons of Sparta</em>. It was developed by Mega Cat Studios, a developer known for its love of retro games — it even still releases games for the SNES and Genesis. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Given their pedigree, it’s no surprise that <em>Sons of Sparta</em> has vibes of classic 2D action/platformer games. It’s apparently canon for the series and takes place in Kratos’ youth while he trains with his brother. It obviously looks nothing like the other God of War games — but the combat and monsters shown off in the trailer definitely feel right at home in the series. </p><p>Perhaps the most fun part of all this is that it’s available today for $30. While <em>Sons of Sparta</em> looks like a fun curio for God of War fans, it’ll only go so far towards whetting our appetite for that remake series.

At today’s State of Play event, we got to see the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/new-gameplay-details-on-control-resonants-supernatural-action/\" target=\"_blank\">first extended bit of gameplay</a> from <em>Control Resonant</em> — and the combat looks as inspired as ever, though the setting is completely new.</p><p>As we learned in December, the next <em>Control</em> games doesn’t focus on Jesse Faden; instead, you’ll primarily play as her brother Dylan who Jesse was trying to find for much of the first game. Dylan’s out in a warped version of New York City trying to track the game’s Resonant creatures that are responsible for whatever calamity has taken place. We knew this already, but the change of setting from the Bureau of Control building into the more open city setting should go a long way towards making this game feel fresh. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Dylan’s capabilities are also completely different than what we saw from Jesse in the original. There’s a much bigger emphasis on melee combat, as Dylan has a shapeshifting weapon called the Aberrant. You can switch from hammer to blades to other various forms, much in the way that Jesse’s firearm in the first game could morph between different types of guns. </p><p>But the thing that stood out the most to me in the brief preview was the way that NYC completely disobeyed the laws of physics. Buildings and streets would just head into the sky at 90-degree angles —&nbsp;and Dylan’s powers let him completely which surface is the “ground” for him. </p><p>There’s still no firm release date for <em>Control Resonant</em>, but that’s not unreasonable —&nbsp;the game was only announced a few months ago. Remedy says they’re still on target to launch in 2026. And, at the end of today’s PlayStation blog post, they promise that “things are going to get weirder.” Just what I was hoping for!</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-first-control-resonant-gameplay-trailer-shows-dylan-defying-physics-in-a-sideways-nyc-224746545.html?src=rss",

Like the first game, <em>Scars of Kosmora </em>looks to be filled with lush visuals and cute Spirit Companions, but also a surprising amount of boss battles.

As in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, you’ll be able to play the mode with up to three other people online. Players can each choose from one of four classes — samurai, archer, mercenary and shinobi — who excel in different combat scenarios. All four classes can wield a katana and bow, but then they also have access to special weapons and skills. For example,  the samurai can wield the odachi, giving them a sweeping move set against groups of enemies.  You’ll need to use teamwork and your class’s abilities to take down demonic versions of the Yotei Six. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>The mode will arrive alongside the game’s 1.5 patch, and will be free for all <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>owners<em>. </em>At launch,<em> </em>players can look forward to three different mission types. In survival, you’ll be tasked with fighting off increasingly difficult enemies. In story mode, meanwhile, you and one other player will need to complete a series of 12 missions to unlock the expansion’s incursion mode, which will see you siege a fortress belonging to a member of Yotei Six. At first, there will be four strongholds for players to conquer, with a later April patch adding the final bosses. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ghost-of-yoteis-multiplayer-expansion-arrives-march-10-223842684.html?src=rss",

Gail Slater, a former JD Vance adviser and Fox Corp VP, reportedly clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Their longstanding feud is said to have centered around Slater's skepticism of corporate mergers.</p><p>&quot;It is with great sadness and abiding hope that I leave my role as [Assistant Attorney General] for Antitrust today,&quot; Slater <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/gailaslater/status/2021975634445304262\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on X. &quot;It was indeed the honor of a lifetime to serve in this role.&quot;</p><p>Although Slater technically resigned, <em>The Guardian</em> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/12/us-antitrust-gail-slater-ousted-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that she was forced out. The fallout was said to be over her differences with Bondi (who just yesterday <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/pam-bondi-hearing-congress-democrats-epstein\" target=\"_blank\">yelled, insulted and deflected</a> her way through a hearing over the DOJ's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/09/jamie-raskin-doj-cover-up-epstein-files\" target=\"_blank\">stonewalling</a> of the Epstein files).

She opposed the deal out of concerns that it would create a duopoly in cloud computing and wireless networking. In addition, Slater reportedly told Bondi that US intelligence hadn't raised any concerns about blocking the merger. However, CIA Director John Ratcliffe later <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/30/merger-hpe-juniper-networks-national-security\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> that blocking it would pose national security risks because it could lead to the loss of business to China. The Trump administration's merger-friendly DOJ ultimately approved the deal.</p><p>Alongside Bondi, Slater was overseeing the DOJ's review of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery</a>. In December, Trump said he would be involved in the regulatory review. That followed intense lobbying by Netflix and Paramount, the latter of which launched a hostile takeover bid. Earlier this month, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that the department was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/doj-is-investigating-if-netflix-used-anticompetitive-tactics-as-part-of-its-merger-probe-210940856.html\" target=\"_blank\">investigating whether Netflix was involved</a> in anticompetitive practices during the process.</p><p>Slater's ousting also comes weeks ahead of the DOJ's antitrust trial against Ticketmaster owner Live Nation.

This week, they made good on those threats. According to <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring\"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, union members confirmed that at least 1,200 staff participated in the three-day strike, which was due to run from February 10 to February 12.</p>\n<p>While the strike action primarily took place in France, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>was told that Ubisoft’s Milan office also took part. The union Solidaires Informatique, which represents French workers from a number of companies in the video game sector, including Blizzard and Ubisoft, had previously <a href=\"https://x.com/SolInfoJeuVideo/status/1615263954955116546/photo/2\">called</a> for strikes to take place on January 27. Their demands included a 10 percent increase on all salaries and the implementation of a 4-day work week.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Some striking employees held up signs outside Ubisoft’s Paris headquarters, with one (pictured) wearing a Rabbids mask to hide their face. Their grievances are wide-ranging. As well as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-proposes-even-more-layoffs-after-last-weeks-studio-closures-and-game-cancellations-192703241.html\">reportedly</a> laying off hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/star-wars-outlaws-developer-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm-face-layoffs-134234968.html\">employees</a> already in 2026, Ubisoft also introduced a <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/dont-call-it-a-layoff-ubisoft-issues-a-full-return-to-office-order-for-all-employees-as-it-confirms-more-studio-closures-are-coming/\">mandate</a> for its staff to return to work on site for five days a week. One employee who publicly voiced their disapproval of the new policy was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-fires-employee-who-publicly-criticized-its-rto-plan-220913747.html\">reportedly</a> fired for doing so.</p>\n<p>Ubisoft has had a rocky start to 2026 on the software side too. The long-awaited <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </em>remake was among six games <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-among-six-games-canceled-by-ubisoft-175801132.html\">canceled</a> by the struggling publisher last month, when it also confirmed several studio closures as part of the company’s organizational restructuring.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, Feb. 12 2026, 12:39PM ET:  </strong>&quot;We understand these changes, particularly those affecting work organization, are generating strong feelings,&quot; Ubisoft wrote in a statement shared with Engadget. &quot;Since the announcement, we have held a series of discussions and information sessions at multiple levels to help teams better understand the new organization and to give them the opportunity to share their questions and concerns.&quot; The company added that it &quot;remains committed to maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with employees and employee representatives.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/1200-ubisoft-workers-went-on-strike-in-response-to-company-restructuring-and-mandatory-return-to-work-policy-163714986.html?src=rss",

If I&#8217;m tired, it&#8217;s burnout. If I&#8217;m irritated, it&#8217;s dysregulation. If I don&#8217;t reply to a message immediately, I&#8217;m either protecting my boundaries or avoiding intimacy. I am never simply annoyed. I am always processing.</p>\n\t<p>To be fair, some of this shift was necessary. Therapy helps. Naming patterns helps. Talking about things publicly has helped people survive things they otherwise might not have. Awareness is progress. My awareness, however, has tipped into surveillance.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Being in therapy these last few years has been great, essential even. But I feel what Hussain is talking about here. One of the helpful things I&#8217;ve learned is that while you do need to change and grow, you still need to be yourself. I forget who, but someone once said that the job of an editor is to make a writer sound more like themselves. That&#8217;s probably true of the therapeutic process as well, including the part we&#8217;re responsible for.\n</p>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sara%20Hussain\">Sara Hussain</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/therapy\">therapy</a></p>",
