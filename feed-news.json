But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day.

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

After years of speculation, multiple reports now suggest Apple could be aiming for a launch in the second half of 2026, with new details trickling out about the phone’s design, display tech and where it might sit in the iPhone lineup.</p><p>As with any unannounced Apple product, nothing is locked in. Features can change, timelines can move and some ideas may never make it beyond internal testing. That said, recent reporting from supply-chain sources, analysts and leakers gives us a clearer picture of how Apple might approach its first foldable and how it could try to set itself apart from rivals like Samsung and Google.</p><p>Below, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering everything from possible release timing and form factor to display details, cameras and pricing. We’ll keep updating this post as new information emerges.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-could-the-iphone-fold-launch\">When could the iPhone Fold launch?</h2><p>Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://theorg.com/org/bloomberg/org-chart/mark-gurman\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Gurman</a> has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-11/apple-2027-plans-tabletop-robot-20th-anniversary-iphone-ios-19-wi-fi-feature\" target=\"_blank\">ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027</a>. Analyst <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\" target=\"_blank\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.</p><p>Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-iphone-fold-look-like\">What will the iPhone Fold look like?</h2><p>Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-already-thinking-about-its-second-foldable-iphone-and-it-may-be-a-clamshell-202312700.html\" target=\"_blank\">clamshell flip phone</a>.</p><p>When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3030017/a-case-maker-might-have-leaked-the-iphone-fold-design.html\" target=\"_blank\">CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds</a> suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-hands-on-the-super-sleek-precursor-to-apples-upcoming-foldable-185851102.html\" target=\"_blank\"> iPhone Air as a potential preview</a> of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.</p><p>If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.</p><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a476c2e0-9780-11f0-bd4b-d87caa240702\" style=\"height: 1263px; width: 2400px;\" /><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><h2 id=\"jump-link-display-and-the-crease-question\">Display and the crease question</h2><p>The display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.</p><p>Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-crease-less-foldable-oled-panel-showcased-z-fold-8/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel</a>, which several sources — including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a> — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.</p><p>According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.</p><p>If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-cameras-and-biometrics\">Cameras and biometrics</h2><p>Camera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:</p><ul><li><p>Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)</p></li><li><p>One punch-hole camera on the outer display</p></li><li><p>One under-display camera on the inner screen</p></li></ul><p>Several sources claim <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple will avoid Face ID</a> entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-will-reportedly-bring-back-touch-id-on-a-foldable-iphone-135831748.html\" target=\"_blank\">rely on Touch ID</a> built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.</p><p>Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://wccftech.com/apples-first-foldable-iphone-to-have-a-24-megapixel-under-display-selfie-camera-no-faceid/\" target=\"_blank\">rumored 24MP sensor</a> would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-iphone-folds-hinge-and-materials\">iPhone Fold’s hinge and materials</h2><p>The hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/14/iphone-folds-titanium-liquid-metal-rumors-just-wont-go-away\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple reports claim Apple will use </a>Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.</p><p>Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/youtuber-jon-prosser-posts-foldable-iphone-renders\" target=\"_blank\">Leaks from Jon Prosser</a> also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-battery-and-other-components\">Battery and other components&nbsp;</h2><p>Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=224077504572&amp;navType=by\" target=\"_blank\">multiple Asian supply-chain reports</a>, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.</p><p>That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-price\">Price</h2><p>None of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone</a> ever.</p><p>Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,”</a> while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.</p><p>Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-foldable-design-upgrades-price-and-more-130000217.html?src=rss",

Starting in March, all users will have a &quot;teen-appropriate experience&quot; by default. Unlocking adult content and age-gated spaces will require a (usually one-time) verification process.</p><p>The platform's big safety update encompasses communication settings, restricted access to age-gated spaces and content filtering. Users who aren't verified as adults will see blurred sensitive content. In addition, age-restricted channels, servers and app commands will be blocked. DMs and friend requests from unknown users will be routed to a separate inbox.</p><p>If you're an adult, removing these restrictions will require one of two verification methods at launch. You can take a selfie video for age estimation or submit a government ID to Discord's vendor partners. (Let's just hope the age estimations <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/robloxs-age-verification-system-is-reportedly-a-trainwreck-220320016.html\" target=\"_blank\">work better than Roblox's</a>.) The company stresses that the video selfies you submit for age estimation never leave your device. And it claims ID documents sent to its vendor partners are deleted quickly, &quot;in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.&quot;</p><p>Although Discord says the process will be one-and-done for most people, some may be required to submit multiple forms of verification. It also says that additional verification options will arrive in the future, including an age inference model that runs in the background.</p><p>This isn’t the company’s first attempt at beefing up its child safety measures. In 2023, it <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/discord-bans-teen-dating-servers-and-the-sharing-of-ai-generated-csam-071626058.html\" target=\"_blank\">banned teen dating channels</a> and AI-generated CSAM. Later that year, it added <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/discords-latest-teen-safety-blitz-starts-with-content-filters-and-automated-warnings-150031569.html\" target=\"_blank\">content filters and automated warnings</a>. Those changes followed an <em>NBC News</em> report that 35 adults had been prosecuted on charges of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/discord-still-has-a-child-safety-issue-085304790.html\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;kidnapping, grooming or sexual assault&quot; that involved Discord communication</a>.</p><p>Alongside today’s changes, Discord is recruiting for a new Teen Council. The group will include 10 to 12 teens aged 13 to 17. The company says this &quot;will help ensure Discord understands — not assumes — what teens need, how they build meaningful connections, and what makes them feel safe and supported online.&quot; This sounds like the corporate equivalent of the parenting advice: “Don’t just talk <em>to</em> your children; listen to them, too.”</p><p>The child safety changes will start rolling out globally in early March. Both new and existing users will be required to submit verification for adult content.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/discord-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-access-adult-content-140000218.html?src=rss",

A four-pack of the first-gen Bluetooth trackers is on sale for $64, which is just about a record-low price (only $1 more). That's a 35 percent discount on the pack.</p> \n<p>Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag</a> down to about $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>If you use Apple devices and consider yourself to be a serial thing-misplacer, AirTags are extremely useful. Adding one to your account takes a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network so well established, locating missing items has never been easier.</p> \n<p>Using your iPhone you can trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively Precision Finding can be used to pinpoint its location via Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone, paying attention to the vibrations that signal you’re getting closer.</p> \n<p>A reminder again that the above deals apply to the first-generation AirTag only. Apple introduced a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\">tracker</a> with greater range and a louder speaker last month, which <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0GJTFXNRX&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e745850-e368-4111-83ab-157ddbe84ac4&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=retail&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmU3NDU4NTAtZTM2OC00MTExLTgzYWItMTU3ZGRiZTg0YWM0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaPN9LXQY-0xtODu-zAc_6biP338yFAO58xyoY7PRH7K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-AirTag-2nd-Generation-Precision%2Fdp%2FB0GJTFXNRX%2F\">retail</a>s at the same price as its predecessor.

Today, we might have a clue. This, though, is no Apple Car. It's the Ferrari Luce (&quot;light&quot; in Italian), the actual name for the EV formerly known as Elettrica, and I'm fresh from getting a walkthrough of the thing from Sir Ive himself. At a glance things look like you might have expected, but there are a few surprises here.</p><p>While Ferrari has sold hybrids in some form or another since 2013's LaFerrari, Luce (née Elettrica) will be the company's first all-electric machine. We got our first look underneath back in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/ferraris-first-ev-is-coming-next-year-with-big-speed-big-sound-and-a-jony-ive-design-083000380.html\" target=\"_blank\">October</a>, when we saw the chassis, battery pack and other details that pointed to this being a larger, more family-friendly machine than your average Ferrari. Last week, I got a look at the next major component, the interior, which comes courtesy of LoveFrom.</p><p>LoveFrom is the house that Jony Ive founded after leaving Apple in 2019. The obsessive design firm, which currently numbers about 60 employees, was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-and-jony-ives-startup-seal-the-deal-194408516.html\" target=\"_blank\">acquired by OpenAI</a> for $6.5 billion last year. LoveFrom has thus far taken on a medley of projects, like the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/jony-ives-first-post-apple-hardware-project-is-a-60000-turntable-163040450.html\" target=\"_blank\">$60,000 Linn Sondek LP12 turntable</a>, but the Luce could be among the company's biggest projects so far — at least in terms of literal dimensions.</p><p>If you're familiar with the designs that Apple produced under Ive's tenure, particularly in the era beginning with the iPhone 4, you'll feel right at home here. The overall aesthetic is one dominated by squircles and circles, all with absolute, minute perfection and symmetry.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FERRARI-LUCE_SHIFTER_EVENT_PHOTO_sRGB_4K_72DPI_16x9.jpg\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Ferrari</div></figure><p>At first blush, it's a bit clinical, but dig deeper, start poking and prodding, and you'll see there's a real sense of charm here. Fun little details and genuinely satisfying tactility begin to reveal themselves. The key, for example, has a yellow panel with an E Ink background. Push the key into the magnetized receiver in the center console, and the yellow on the key dims, moving across to glow through the top of the glass shifter. It’s meant to symbolize a sort of transference of life.</p><p>The shifter isn't the only thing that's glass. There are 40-odd pieces of Corning Gorilla Glass scattered throughout the cockpit, everything from the shifter surround to the slightly convex lenses in the gauge cluster. What isn't glass is aluminum, much of it anodized in your choice of three colors: gray, dark gray and rose gold.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, all that sure does sound like I'm writing about a new iPhone and not the latest Ferrari. But where Apple has been pruning every physical control it possibly can from its devices lately, LoveFrom will insert some great tactility in the Luce. The shifter moves through its detents satisfyingly, the air vents open and close with a clear snick and the paddles behind the steering wheel pop with a great feel.</p><p>My favorite feature is the windshield wiper control, a little dial in the upper-right of the steering wheel face. It features a tiny lens that magnifies the current setting. It's actually magnifying one of four custom OLED panels, 200 ppi units from Samsung, cut and shaped to deliver LoveFrom's ornate style.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FERRARI-LUCE_STEERING_ASSEMBLY_EVENT_PHOTO_sRGB_4K_72DPI_16X9.jpg\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>The gauge cluster behind the steering wheel, or binnacle as it's more formally called here, is two OLED displays stacked on top of each other, with a physical needle sandwiched between serving as a pseudo-tachometer for this car without an engine. The gauges change and morph as you move from one mode to the next.&nbsp;</p><p>The center display is a 10.12-inch OLED perforated with plenty of holes to allow some pleasingly chunky toggle switches through, plus a glass volume knob. The little clock in the upper-right can turn into a stopwatch or a compass, with its needles swinging about depending on the mode. The whole central control panel pivots and swivels. Just grab the big handle below and drag it where you want it.&nbsp;</p><p>The attention to detail on everything is astonishing. Even the rails that hold the seats to the floor are gently shaped and anodized to match the rest of the interior.&nbsp;</p><p>Ive was on hand to unveil the interior, clearly a little nervous about showing all this for the first time. After five years of working confidentially on this topic, Ive said he was &quot;enormously excited&quot; and &quot;completely terrified&quot; to provide our first real glimpse at the Luce.&nbsp;</p><p>Marc Newson, who founded LoveFrom with Ive, said: &quot;Jony and I share a really, really deep interest in automotive things and vehicles. Actually, I'd go so far as to say that that is probably a hobby of both of ours.&quot;</p><p>Both Ive and Newson own many vintage machines, and Ive said that modern cars &quot;are missing some things that we love about our old Ferraris.&quot; Things like tactility. &quot;It was very clear to us that we needed to figure out as many ways as possible to viscerally and physically connect to the interface,&quot; Ive said.</p><figure><img alt=\"Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FERRARI-LUCE_CONTROL_PANEL_OVERVIEW_HERO_sRGB_6K_72DPI_16X9.jpg\" style=\"height: 1441px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>So, while the Luce does have that pivoting touchscreen, it's far from the vehicle's primary interface. Ive said he hopes that physical connection and all the clever touches create a uniquely charming vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p>Ive told me that the LoveFrom team has genuinely enjoyed working with Ferrari. &quot;It's been really lovely,&quot; he said, and he praised Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna's dedication to this project and where it might lead down the road. &quot;Benedetto is an amazing engineer,&quot; he said, &quot;he's really interested in what can be learned more broadly.&quot;</p><p>The biggest challenge might have been working within the automotive industry. Here, design, form and function are key, but safety is of the utmost importance. &quot;It's very hard,&quot; Ive told me. &quot;I've never worked in an area that's so regulated. Some of it's great, because you understand why, and people's safety is certainly important, but some of it drives you nuts.&quot;</p><p>It's far and away the most exciting and fresh interior I've seen outside of the ultra-rare machines like the $4 million Bugatti Tourbillon. But it's so clinically precise and refined that it lacks the rough and raw feel that typifies many classic Ferraris. Whether that's a good or a bad thing will be debated endlessly, and I look forward to reading your comments, but I do figure it'll go a long way to delivering the kind of new clientele that Ferrari must be targeting with the Luce.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/FERRARI-LUCE_MULTIGRAPH_EVENT_PHOTO_sRGB_4K_72DPI_16X9.jpg\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption>Ferrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\"></div></figure><p>Ultimately, whether anyone will want one is hugely dependent on how good the rest of the car looks and how much it will cost. Those are questions we still can't answer, at least not until May, when CEO Vigna says we can expect the Luce's full reveal.&nbsp;</p><p>For Ive, though, it seemed like that won't be the end of the road for this automotive journey. &quot;At the end of a project, there are two products. There's what you've made, and there's what you've learned. I've always been fascinated by what you've learned,&quot; he told me. &quot;And honestly, we've learned so much.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/inside-ferraris-luce-ev-the-jony-ive-interior-is-here-130000211.html?src=rss",

This is a rideshare feature in which teenagers can request their own rides, which is similar to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uber-will-start-rolling-out-teen-accounts-with-safety-features-next-week-150018174.html\"><ins>Uber's pre-existing platform</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>Teens request the rides on their own, but parents can keep an eye on things every step of the way.

They also get updates at pickup and drop-off and the app allows communication with the driver when needed.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>This is a rideshare service for teens, so there are several new safety features. The drivers must &quot;meet the highest standards&quot; on the platform. Lyft says they get annual background checks and must have &quot;proven safe driving records, positive passenger interactions and experience behind the wheel.&quot;</p>\n<p>The teens have to enter a PIN to ensure the correct rider gets in the car, which is something Lyft has been <a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-ca/all/articles/6319159425-PIN-verification-for-riders\"><ins>experimenting with for adults</ins></a>. Audio recording of the ride is on by default, for an added layer of safety.</p>\n<p>Lyft Teen is available right now, though not everywhere. The company has launched the platform in 200 markets, including New York City, Chicago, Atlanta and Miami, among others. It's coming to more cities as the year winds on.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/lyft-rolls-out-teen-accounts-with-enhanced-safety-protections-110002761.html?src=rss",

Colophon: All the rest. The Epstein class and collapse porn (permalink) It's hard to talk about the Epstein class without thinking about \"The Economy\" &#8211; \"The Economy\" in the sense of a kind of mystical, free-floating entity whose health or sickness determines the outcomes for all the rest of us, whom we must make sacrifices to if we are to prosper. As nebulous as \"The Economy\" is as an entity, there's an economic priesthood that claims it can measure and even alter the course of the economy using complex mathematics. We probably won't ever understand their methods, but we can at least follow an indicator or two, such as changes to GDP, an aggregated statistic that is deceptively precise, given that it subsumes any number of estimates, qualitative judgments and wild-ass guesses, which are all disguised behind an official statistic that is often published to three decimal places. There's plenty to criticize about GDP: a healthy GDP doesn't necessarily mean that the average worker is better off. When your rent goes up, so does GDP. Same with your salary going down (provided this results in more spending by your boss). GDP isn't really a measure of the health of \"The Economy\" &#8211; it's a measure of the parts of \"The Economy\" that make rich people (that is, the Epstein class) better off. But what if there was a way to make money from calamitous collapses in GDP? What if the wealthy didn't just win when \"number go up,\" but also when \"number eat shit?\" The latest batch of Epstein emails includes a particularly ghoulish exchange between Epstein and his business partner, the anti-democracy activist and billionaire Peter Thiel: https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00824843.pdf The email is dated 26 Jun 2016, right after Brexit, and in it, Epstein writes: return to tribalism . counter to globalization. amazing new alliances. you and I both agreed zero interest rates were too high, as i said in your office. finding things on their way to collapse , was much easier than finding the next bargain This is a perfect example of what Naomi Klein calls \"disaster capitalism.\" It's been the norm since the crash of 2008, when bankers were made whole through public bailouts and mortgage holders were evicted by the millions to \"foam the runway\" for the banks: https://wallstreetonparade.com/2012/08/how-treasury-secretary-geithner-foamed-the-runways-with-childrens-shattered-lives/ The crash of 2008 turned a lot of people's homes &#8211; their only substantial possessions &#8211; into \"distressed assets\" that were purchased at fire-sale prices by Wall Street investors, who turned around and rented those homes out to people who were now priced out of the housing market at rents that kept them too poor to ever afford a home, under slum conditions that crawled with insects and black mold: https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/01/housing-is-a-human-right/ Note here that economic collapse helps the Epstein class only if society has no social safety net. If Obama had supported homeowners instead of banks, there wouldn't have been a foreclosure crisis and thus there wouldn't have been any \"distressed assets\" flooding the market. So it's no surprise that the Epstein class are also obsessed with austerity. Peter Mandelson (British Labour's \"Prince of Darkness\") is a close ally of Epstein's, and also a key figure in the crushing austerity agenda of Blair, Brown and Starmer. He's a machine for turning Parliamentary majorities into distressed assets at scale. Same for Steve Bannon, another close Epstein ally, who boasts about his alliances with far-right figures who exalt the capital class and call for deregulation and the elimination of public services: Le Pen, Salvini, Farage. Combine that with Epstein and Thiel's gloating about \"finding things on their way to collapse&#8230;much easier than finding the next bargain,\" and it starts to feel like these guys are even happier with \"number eat shit\" than they are with \"number go up.\" Trump is the undisputed king of the Epstein class, and he seems determined to drive \"The Economy\" over a cliff. Take his tariff program, modeled on the McKinley tariffs of 1890, which led to the Panic of 1893, a financial crisis that saw one in four American workers forced into unemployment and 15,000 businesses into bankruptcy (that's a lot of distressed assets!): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1893 Then there's Trump's mass deportation program, which will force lots of businesses (farms, restaurants, etc) into bankruptcy, creating another massive pool of distressed assets. Trump's given ICE $75b, while the DoJ Antitrust Division and FTC (which protect Americans from corporate scams) have seen their budgets take a real-terms cut. The majority of DoJ lawyers and FBI agents are working on immigration cases (against workers, not employers, mind!). The Antitrust Division has $275m to fight all of America's corporate crime: https://www.organizedmoney.fm/p/white-collar-crime-enforcement-in I'm not saying that Trump is trying to induce another massive economic crash. I'm saying, rather, that within his coalition there is a substantial bloc of powerful, wealthy people who are on the hunt for \"things on their way to collapse,\" and who are doubtless maneuvering to frustrate other Trump coalition members who are solely committed to \"number go up.\" Even the collapse of crypto creates lots of opportunities to \"buy the dip.\" Not the dip in crypto (crypto's going to zero), but the dip in all the real things people bought with real money they got by borrowing against their shitcoins. The thousand-plus children that Epstein lured to his island rape-camp were often \"distressed assets\" in their own right: Julie K Brown's groundbreaking reporting on Epstein for the Miami Herald described how he sought out children whose parents were poor, or neglectful, or both, on the grounds that those children would be \"on their way to collapse,\" too. The Epstein class's commitment to destroying \"The Economy\" makes sense when you understand that trashing civilization is \"much easier than finding the next bargain.\" They want to buy the dip, so they're creating the dip. They don't need the whole number to go up, just theirs. They know that inclusive economies are more prosperous for society as a whole, but it makes criminals and predators worse off. The New Deal kicked off a period of American economic growth never seen before or since, but the rich despised it, because a prosperous economy is one in which it gets harder and harder to find \"things on their way to collapse,\" and thus nearly impossible to \"find[] the next bargain.\" (Image: Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 3.0) Hey look at this (permalink) RIP, Dave Farber

Unlock lyrics with Premium.” Free users get lyrics for five songs, then after that, will only see a few lines before the rest of the song is blurred.</p><p>Google has been testing the feature since at least September with a limited number of users, according to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-music-test-lyrics-paywall-subscription/\" target=\"_blank\">previous reports</a>. It’s been <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-music-lyrics-paywall-test-3596417/\" target=\"_blank\">speculated</a> that YouTube may have made the change to recuperate costs spent with lyric aggregators like Musixmatch. Spotify also put lyrics behind its Premium paywall <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-premium-lyrics-3439096/\" target=\"_blank\">in 2024</a>, but a user backlash forced it to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/spotify-lyrics-are-back-for-free-users-175200293.html\" target=\"_blank\">reinstate the feature</a> for free users. </p><p>Google has yet to confirm the change, and while it appears to be a larger rollout, the feature change could still be in testing. YouTube Music’s Premium subscription costs $10.99 in the US with ad-free playback, offline downloads, AI features and more — the same as its main rivals Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/music/youtube-music-starts-limiting-lyrics-for-free-users-101258311.html?src=rss",

The best AirTag accessories help you attach it securely, protect it from wear and tear and fit it naturally into how you carry your stuff. A good holder can make the difference between an AirTag that’s always with you and one that’s easy to forget.<br /><br />Accessories range from slim wallet inserts and low-profile key rings to more rugged mounts designed for bikes, luggage or pet collars. Materials vary just as widely, from leather and silicone to hard plastic shells built for travel and outdoor use. Many options also come in multiple colors and finishes, making it easy to balance durability with a look that matches your gear. We’ve covered the best AirTag accessories available now, so you can find the right fit for how you use your tracker.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-airtag-holders-for-2026\">Best AirTag holders for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-airtag-holder-faqs\">AirTag holder FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-why-do-airtags-need-a-holder\">Why do AirTags need a holder?</h3> \n<p>AirTags need a holder because they do not have built-in keyring holes like Tile, Chipolo and other Bluetooth trackers do.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-you-attach-an-airtag-to-things\">How do you attach an AirTag to things?</h3> \n<p>You'll need a holder or case to attach an AirTag to your stuff. If you're comfortable slipping an AirTag into an interior pocket of a bag or coat, you can do so without an extra accessory. But if you want to use one to keep track of your keys, wallet, backpack or even your pet on their collar, you'll need an accessory that can accommodate that use case.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-airtag-holders-affect-tracking-performance\">Do AirTag holders affect tracking performance?</h3> \n<p>No, AirTag holders should not affect tracking performance.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-airtag-holders-protect-against-scratches-and-impacts\">Do AirTag holders protect against scratches and impacts?</h3> \n<p>Yes, AirTag holders can protect against scratches and impacts. Many AirTag cases encircle the edge of the tracker only, leave the two disk sides exposed. For the most protection, look for an AirTag holder than goes around the entire Bluetooth tracker like a sleeve.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html?src=rss",

It'll still chase waves, plunder pillowy post-blizzard powder, and drive to the edge of sky-penetrating big wall climbs, but after the sun sets, it's much more than just a crash pad on a Sprinter chassis, providing a comfy, oversized living space complete with transformable multimedia lounge, master bedroom and dry bath.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/rvs-motorhomes/leisure-travel-unity-tbx-adventure-motorhome/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/rvs-motorhomes/\">RVs and Motorhomes</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/adventure-vehicles/\">Adventure Vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/outdoors/\">Outdoors</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/motorhome/\" rel=\"tag\">Motorhome</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/motorhomes/\" rel=\"tag\">Motorhomes</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/leisure-travel-vans/\" rel=\"tag\">Leisure Travel Vans</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/\" rel=\"tag\">RV</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/off-grid/\" rel=\"tag\">Off-grid</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/\" rel=\"tag\">Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/mercedes-benz/\" rel=\"tag\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/\" rel=\"tag\">Outdoors and Camping</a></p>",

Posts from Trump's first term will be taken down too.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike how past administrations have handled the removal of social media content and the transition of accounts, these posts won't be kept in a public archive. A spokesperson for the State Department confirmed this to <em>NPR,</em> and said the move is meant &quot;to limit confusion on U.S government policy and to speak with one voice to advance the President, Secretary, and Administration's goals and messaging. It will preserve history while promoting the present.&quot; The spokesperson also called the X accounts &quot;one of our most powerful tools for advancing the America First goals.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-ftc-has-removed-all-business-blog-posts-from-the-biden-administration-214734633.html\" target=\"_blank\">Trump administration</a> has been <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/court-orders-the-cdc-and-fda-to-restore-deleted-web-pages-related-to-gender-identity-133008251.html\" target=\"_blank\">purging information</a> from <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/the-usda-will-republish-climate-change-information-online-following-farmer-lawsuit-211907357.html\" target=\"_blank\">government websites</a> since he took office last year.

Thanks to a screenshot from the report, we can see that the latest T1 design also changed the camera array, which first resembled the iPhone's but now has three cameras in a misaligned vertical stack.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>As for the price, Hendrickson told <em>The Verge</em> that anyone who paid the $100 deposit will still pay $499 total for the T1 as an &quot;introductory price,&quot; but that later customers could fork up to $999. Thomas also revealed that the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-golden-trump-phone-is-almost-certainly-not-made-in-the-us-174536590.html\">T1 smartphone</a> will go through &quot;final assembly&quot; in Miami and no longer be &quot;proudly designed and built in the United States,&quot; as seen in the introductory <a href=\"https://www.trump.com/media/trump-mobile-launches-a-bold-new-wireless-service\">press release</a>. Instead, the website now shows a description that says, &quot;with American hands behind every device.&quot; We still don't have a release date — and now we don't even have a final price — but the website still claims the T1 smartphone will be released &quot;later this year.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-mobiles-t1-phone-is-apparently-still-coming-but-itll-be-uglier-and-more-expensive-190626835.html?src=rss",

Now, the Analogue 3D will come in Ghost, Glacier, Extreme Green, Ocean and yes, even <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/analogues-limited-edition-transparent-pocket-handhelds-come-in-seven-colors-150049816.html\">Atomic Purple</a>.</p>\n<p>It may just be a cosmetic upgrade, but it's worth noting that each of the colorways has matching cables, power adapters and 16GB SD cards that come preinstalled. Analogue even partnered with <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://x.com/analogue/status/2019803278088020241?s=20\">8BitDo</a> again to create color-matched controllers that complete the colorful retro experience.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Analogue and 8BitDo worked together to create color-matched controllers for the 3D Prototype version.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/ae98e1c0-0447-11f1-bef3-6a0f44598fa1\" style=\"height: 2185px; width: 3276px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">8BitDo</div></figure>\n<p>As usual, Analogue said this latest run will be available in &quot;highly limited quantities,&quot; starting on February 9 at 11AM ET. Be sure to set a reminder because the first <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-analogue-3d-will-be-restocked-on-november-24-but-itll-cost-20-more-173615217.html\">Analogue 3D</a> drop sold out quickly and the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-is-weaponizing-your-nostalgia-with-these-translucent-versions-of-its-3d-console-181105740.html\">Funtastic colorways</a> went out of stock just as fast. According to Analogue, the consoles will go for $299.99 and start shipping 24 to 48 hours after orders are completed. 8BitDo said the $49.99 controllers will be available for preorder at the same time as the 3D console, but see its first shipments starting in April.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/analogue-unearths-n64-prototype-colors-for-its-limited-edition-3d-console-171923894.html?src=rss",

In this episode of How It Hits, we dive into the show's unique \"documentary realism\" style—a filming technique that makes the high-stakes world of the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center feel more immersive than any other show on TV.\n\nExplore how The Pitt builds on the legacy of medical drama giants like ER and Grey's Anatomy, while forging its own path with 100% handheld camerawork and the innovative ZeeGee rig. We also go behind the scenes with cinematographer Johanna Coelho and Dr. Joe Sachs to learn how the show blends true-to-life medical cases with character-driven drama to create a truly unforgettable viewing experience.",

Now that February is here, our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">reviews</a> team is flush with new devices to test, which means you’ve got a lot to catch up on if you haven’t been following along. Read on for a roundup of the most compelling new gear we’ve tested recently from gaming, PCs, cameras and more. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-nex-playground\">Nex Playground</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>If you still have a fondness for the Xbox Kinect, the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-nex-playground-is-everything-xbox-kinect-wanted-to-be-133000397.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nex Playground</a> might be right up your alley. Senior reporter Devindra Hardawar recently put the tiny box through its paces and found an active gaming experience that’s fun for the whole family. “While I have some concerns about the company’s subscription model, Nex has accomplished a rare feat: It developed a simple box that makes it easy for your entire family to jump into genuinely innovative games and experiences,” he wrote.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-msis-prestige-14-flip-ai\">MSI's Prestige 14 Flip AI+</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Devindra also tested MSI’s latest laptop, the powerful <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-prestige-14-flip-ai-review-an-ultraportable-for-arc-raiders-thanks-to-intels-panther-lake-160000606.html\" target=\"_blank\">Prestige 14 Flip AI+</a>. While the machine got high marks for its performance, display and connectivity, he noted that the overall experience is hindered by subpar keyboard and truly awful trackpad. “As one of the earliest Panther Lake laptops on the market, the $1,299 Prestige 14 Flip AI+ is a solid machine, if you're willing to overlook its touchpad flaws,” he explained. “More than anything though, the Prestige 14 makes me excited to see what other PC makers offer with Intel's new chips.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-shokz-openfit-pro\">Shokz OpenFit Pro</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Fresh off of its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html\" target=\"_blank\">Best of CES</a> selection, I conducted a full review of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/shokz-openfit-pro-review-reducing-distractions-while-keeping-your-ears-open-130000443.html\" target=\"_blank\">OpenFit Pro</a> earbuds from Shokz. I continue to be impressed by the earbuds’ ability to reduce ambient noise while keeping your ears open. And the overall sound quality is excellent for a product that sits outside of your ears. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-sony-a7-v\">Sony A7 V</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Contributing reporter Steve Dent has been busy testing cameras to start the year. This week he added the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sony-a7-v-review-awesome-speed-and-photo-quality-130000592.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sony A7 V</a> to the list, noting the excellent photo quality and accurate autofocus. “The A7 V is an incredible camera for photography, with speeds, autofocus accuracy and image quality ahead of rivals, including the Canon R6 III, Panasonic S1 II and Nikon Z6 III,” he said. “However, Sony isn’t keeping up with those models for video.” </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-apple-airtag-2026\">Apple AirTag (2026)</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Our first Editors’ Choice device of 2026 is Apple’s updated <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\" target=\"_blank\">AirTag</a>. All of the upgrades lead to a better overall item tracker, according to UK bureau chief Mat Smith. “There's no doubt the second-gen AirTags are improved, and thankfully, upgrading to the new capabilities doesn’t come at too steep a cost,” he concluded. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-shokz-openfit-pro-nex-playground-sony-a7-v-and-more-123400089.html?src=rss",
