According to Scott, these NGOs would allow for &quot;long-term counter lobbying&quot; when publishers end support for certain video games.</p>\n<p>&quot;Let me start off by saying I think we're going to win this, namely the problem of publishers destroying video games that you've already paid for,&quot; Scott said in the video. According to Scott, the NGOs will work on getting the original Stop Killing Games petition codified into EU law, while also pursuing more watchdog actions, like setting up a system to report publishers for revoking access to purchased video games.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html\">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign started as a reaction to Ubisoft's delisting of <em>The Crew</em> from players' libraries. The controversial decision stirred up concerns about how publishers have the ultimate say on delisting video games. After crossing <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html\">a million signatures</a> last year, the movement's leadership has been busy exploring the next steps.</p>\n<p>According to Scott, the campaign leadership will meet with the European Commission soon, but is also working on a 500-page legal paper that reveals some of the industry's current controversial practices. In the meantime, the ongoing efforts have led to a change of heart from Ubisoft since the publisher updated <em>The Crew 2</em> with <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-crew-2-is-now-playable-offline-211629508.html\">an offline mode</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-campaign-will-set-up-ngos-in-the-eu-and-us-203359604.html?src=rss",

On Friday, US District Judge Beth Bloom upheld the jury's decision to hold Tesla partially responsible for a deadly crash that happened in 2019 and involved the self-driving <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-stops-using-autopilot-to-promote-its-evs-in-california-112533060.html\">Autopilot</a> feature.</p>\n<p>The judge added that there was enough evidence to support the jury's verdict, which was delivered in August 2025 and ordered Tesla to pay millions in compensatory and punitive damages to the two victims in the case. Judge Bloom added that Tesla didn't present any new arguments to dispute the decision.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While the case has been moving along recently, the incident dates back to several years ago when the driver of a <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-updated-model-y-performance-launches-for-57490-123018911.html\">Model S</a>, George McGee, was using Tesla's Autopilot feature while bending down to retrieve a dropped phone. The Model S then crashed into an SUV that was parked on a shoulder, where Naibel Benavides Leon and Dillon Angulo were standing aside. Benavides was killed in the crash, while Angulo was severely injured.</p>\n<p>Tesla hasn't publicly commented on Judge Bloom's decision yet, but it won't be a surprise to see the company appeal the latest ruling with a higher court. Tesla's lawyers previously tried to pin the blame on the driver, claiming that the Model S and Autopilot weren't defective. As this major case plays out, Tesla is also facing several investigations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for both its <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/feds-investigate-tesla-over-inaccurate-autopilot-and-fsd-crash-reports-175837772.html\">Autopilot</a> and <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-launches-probe-into-teslas-full-self-driving-tech-141102274.html\">Full-Self Driving</a> features.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-judge-ruled-tesla-still-has-to-pay-243-million-for-a-fatal-crash-involving-autopilot-174548093.html?src=rss",

But because AirTags and other Bluetooth trackers are small and discreet, concerns about unwanted tracking are understandable. Apple has spent years building safeguards into the AirTag and the Find My network to reduce the risk of misuse and to alert people if a tracker they don’t own appears to be moving with them.</p><p>If you’re worried about whether an AirTag or similar tracker might be following you, here’s how Apple’s unwanted tracking alerts work, what notifications to look for and what you can do on both iPhone and Android.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-airtag-tracking-alerts-work\">How AirTag tracking alerts work</h2><p>AirTags, compatible Find My network accessories and certain AirPods models use Apple’s Find My network, which relies on Bluetooth signals and nearby devices to update their location. To prevent misuse, Apple designed these products with features that are meant to alert someone if a tracker that isn’t linked to their Apple Account appears to be traveling with them.</p><p>If an AirTag or another compatible tracker is separated from its owner and detected near you over time, your device may display a notification or the tracker itself may emit a sound. These alerts are intended to discourage someone from secretly tracking another person without their knowledge. Apple has also worked with Google on a cross-platform industry standard, so alerts can appear on both iOS and Android devices, not just iPhones.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-make-sure-tracking-alerts-are-enabled-on-your-iphone\">How to make sure tracking alerts are enabled on your iPhone</h2><p>If you use an iPhone or iPad, tracking notifications are on by default, but it’s worth confirming your settings.</p><p>To receive unwanted tracking alerts, make sure that:</p><ul><li><p>Your device is running iOS 17.5 or later (or iPadOS 17.5 or later). Earlier versions back to iOS 14.5 support basic AirTag alerts, but newer versions add broader compatibility with other trackers.</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth is turned on.</p></li><li><p>Location Services are enabled.</p></li><li><p>Notifications for Tracking Alerts are allowed.</p></li><li><p>Airplane Mode is turned off.</p></li></ul><p>You can check these by opening <strong>Settings</strong>, then navigating to <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, <strong>Location Services and Notifications</strong>. Apple also recommends turning on <strong>Significant Locations</strong> in the <strong>System Services </strong>menu, which helps your device determine when an unknown tracker has traveled with you to places like your home.</p><ol><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>, tap <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, then select <strong>Location Services</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Toggle <strong>Location Services</strong> on.</p></li><li><p>Scroll down and tap <strong>System Services</strong>, then toggle <strong>Significant Locations</strong> on.</p></li></ol><p>If these settings are disabled, your iPhone may not be able to alert you when an AirTag or similar device is nearby.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-tracking-alerts-look-like\">What tracking alerts look like</h2><p>If your iPhone detects a tracker that doesn’t belong to you moving with you, you may see a notification such as:</p><ul><li><p>AirTag Found Moving With You</p></li><li><p>AirPods Detected</p></li><li><p>“Product Name” Found Moving With You</p></li><li><p>Unknown Accessory Detected</p></li></ul><p>Tapping the alert opens the Find My app, which shows a map of where the item was detected near you. The map uses dots to indicate locations where your device noticed the tracker nearby. This doesn’t mean the owner was actively watching your location at those times, only that the tracker was detected in close proximity.</p><p>In some cases, the alert may have an innocent explanation. For example, you might be borrowing someone else’s keys, bag or AirPods. If the item belongs to someone in your Family Sharing group, you can temporarily pause alerts for that item by tapping the notification and opting to turn off alerts for that item either for one day or indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-do-if-you-hear-an-airtag-making-a-sound\">What to do if you hear an AirTag making a sound</h2><p>If an AirTag or compatible tracker has been separated from its owner for a period of time and is moved, it may emit a sound on its own. This is another built-in safety feature meant to draw attention to the device.</p><p>If you hear an unfamiliar chirping or beeping sound, especially from a bag, jacket pocket or vehicle, it’s worth checking your belongings to see if there’s an AirTag or similar tracker inside.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-find-an-unknown-airtag-or-tracker\">How to find an unknown AirTag or tracker</h2><p>If you receive an alert and believe the tracker is still with you, the Find My app offers tools to help locate it.</p><p>From the alert, you can choose to play a sound on the device to help pinpoint where it’s hidden.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Tap the alert.</p></li><li><p>Tap Continue and then tap <strong>Play Sound</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Listen for the sound or play it again to give yourself more time to find the item.</p></li></ol><p>If the tracker is an AirTag and you have a compatible iPhone with ultra wideband connectivity, you may also see a Find Nearby option, which uses Precision Finding to guide you toward it with distance and direction indicators.</p><ol><li><p>Tap the alert.</p></li><li><p>Tap <strong>Continue</strong> and then tap <strong>Find Nearby</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Follow the onscreen instructions. You may need to move around the space until your iPhone connects to the unknown AirTag.</p></li></ol><p>Your iPhone will display the distance and direction of the unknown AirTag, so you can use that information to identify where the unknown AirTag is. When the AirTag is within Bluetooth range of your iPhone, you can tap the <strong>Play Sound</strong> button to listen for it. You can also tap the <strong>Turn Flashlight On</strong> button to provide more light if it’s needed.</p><p>If neither option is available, or if the tracker can’t be located electronically, manually check your belongings. Look through bags, pockets, jackets and vehicles. If you feel unsafe and can’t find the device, Apple recommends going to a safe public place and contacting local law enforcement.</p><figure><img alt=\"The new Apple AirTag that works with Find My app.\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/c6e02161-a1fc-11eb-beff-7f401728d6fb\" style=\"height: 1742px; width: 1306px;\" /><figcaption>The new Apple AirTag that works with Find My app.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Apple</div></figure><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-get-information-about-an-airtag\">How to get information about an AirTag</h2><p>If you find an unknown AirTag, you can learn more about it without needing to unlock it or log in.</p><ol><li><p>Hold the top of your iPhone, or any NFC-capable smartphone, near the white side of the AirTag. A notification should appear.</p></li><li><p>Tap the notification to open a webpage with details about the AirTag. This page includes the serial number and the last four digits of the phone number associated with the owner’s Apple Account.</p></li></ol><p>If the AirTag was marked as lost, the page may also include a message from the owner explaining how to contact them. This can help determine whether the situation is accidental or intentional.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-disable-an-airtag-that-isnt-yours\">How to disable an AirTag that isn’t yours</h2><p>If you confirm that an AirTag is tracking you and it doesn’t belong to you, you can disable it so it stops sharing its location.</p><p>From the Find My alert or information page, select <strong>Instructions to Disable</strong> and follow the steps provided. For an AirTag, this usually involves removing the battery, which immediately stops location updates. Disabling Bluetooth or turning off Location Services on your phone does not stop the AirTag from reporting its location. The device itself must be disabled.</p><p>If you believe the tracker was used for malicious purposes, keep the AirTag and document its details before contacting law enforcement.

With alerts, audible warnings and cross-platform detection on both iOS and Android, most people will be notified if a tracker they don’t own is moving with them. Knowing what these alerts look like and how to respond can help you stay informed, avoid unnecessary panic and take appropriate action if something feels off.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-know-if-an-airtag-is-tracking-you-130000764.html?src=rss",

Read on for the list that also includes a love letter to a tiny camera and another VPN option that worth considering. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-sony-wf-1000xm6\">Sony WF-1000XM6</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Sony’s 1000X earbuds have always been the top pick in our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html\" target=\"_blank\">best wireless earbuds</a> guide. With <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-facing-tougher-competition-160000652.htmlhttps://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-facing-tougher-competition-160000652.html\" target=\"_blank\">the M6</a> though, the company doesn’t do enough to clearly separate itself from the competition like it has in the past. “The two most obvious places the company is lagging behind the competition is ANC performance and overall voice quality, not to mention my continued dissatisfaction with the fit that Sony’s foam tips provide,” I wrote. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-asus-zenbook-duo-2026\">ASUS Zenbook Duo (2026)</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>If you’re looking for something unique in your next laptop, the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-zenbook-duo-2026-review-two-screens-really-are-better-than-one-140000982.html\" target=\"_blank\">ASUS Zenbook Duo</a> is worth considering. Dual screens? Yep. Detachable keyboard? Sure. Good battery life? It does that too. “I'm a believer that one day people will eventually embrace typing on screens with laptops just like they have for smartphones,” senior reporter Sam Rutherford explained. “However, even if you're not willing to make that jump just yet, the Zenbook Duo still has all of its bases covered.” </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-kodak-charmera\">Kodak Charmera</h2>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"A Kodak Charmera is shown pinched between two fingers, with snow and trees seen in the background\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/charm.jpg\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  It's so cute\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>A tiny $30 camera was too cute for our editors to resist. Despite the subpar images it captures, they’re still smitten with the thing. “I've been pleasantly surprised by how much I'm enjoying <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/the-ridiculously-tiny-kodak-charmera-captured-our-hearts-and-lots-of-shoddy-pictures-140000245.html\" target=\"_blank\">the Charmera</a> experience,” weekend editor Its crunchy photos are just good enough to feel like they're successfully preserving a moment in time. And being so tiny, it's really convenient to bring everywhere.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-mullvad-vpn\">Mullvad VPN</h2>\n<p>Senior writer Sam Champman’s latest VPN review is Mullvad, which he says is often regarded as one of the best in terms of overall privacy. “It's not trying to be an everything app — it does privacy and does it well,” he noted. “Of course, it has its own compromises. It's solidly in the middle of the speed pack and occasionally trips up when unblocking streaming sites. The lack of any protocols other than WireGuard grates on me a bit, since it reduces the user's options for troubleshooting.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-sony-wf-1000xm6-asus-zenbook-duo-and-more-130000298.html?src=rss",

Asha Sharma, the President of Microsoft's CoreAI division is taking over Spencer's role, while Sarah Bond, the current President of Xbox, is resigning.</p><p>&quot;I am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me,&quot; Nadella says. &quot;Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.&quot;</p><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 365px;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I’m excited for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asha_shar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@asha_shar</a> as she steps into the CEO role.

Watching her lean in with curiosity and a real desire to strengthen the foundation we've built…</p>— Phil Spencer (@XboxP3) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/2024951219782054359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 20, 2026</a></blockquote>\n\n\n</div><p>In a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/XboxP3/status/2024951219782054359?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">thread on X</a>, Spencer shared his thoughts on Sharma’s new position. “I’m excited for [Asha Sharma] as she steps into the CEO role,” Spencer wrote. “She’s joining an incredible group of people; teams full of talent, heart, and a deep commitment to the players they serve. Watching her lean in with curiosity and a real desire to strengthen the foundation we've built gives me confidence that our Xbox communities will be well supported in the years ahead.”</p><p>Alongside Sharma, Matt Booty, the current head of Xbox Game Studios, is getting promoted to Chief Content Officer, and will report to Sharma. Sarah Bond, who like Spencer served as a public face for the Xbox brand and was assumed to be his successor, is leaving Microsoft to &quot;begin a new chapter.&quot; Bond has yet to make a public statement about her resignation.</p><p>Spencer joined Microsoft in 1988, and has worked on Xbox since at least 2001. He assumed responsibility for Microsoft's gaming brand and its various studios and associated subscription products in 2013, before becoming an Executive VP of Gaming in 2017 and later CEO of Microsoft Gaming in 2022. Spencer's biggest impact on Xbox will likely be remembered as the creation of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-24-xbox-game-pass-launch-date-100-games-june-1st.html\" target=\"_blank\">Game Pass</a>, Microsoft's &quot;Netflix for Games&quot; and the wave of studio acquisitions Microsoft completed from 2018 to 2022, which included smaller studios like <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-09-double-fine-joins-microsoft-studios.html\" target=\"_blank\">Double Fine</a> and the massive<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-now-officially-belongs-to-microsoft-125053787.html\" target=\"_blank\"> $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard King</a>.</p><p>While Microsoft has plenty of developers and IP to fall back on, it's struggled to compete with the likes of Sony and Nintendo during the current console generation. Microsoft's gaming division has gone through <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html\" target=\"_blank\">widespread layoffs</a>, its revenue <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-console-revenue-fell-30-percent-year-over-year-this-summer-012245146.html\" target=\"_blank\">continued to fall</a> throughout 2025 and it raised the prices of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html\" target=\"_blank\">both its consoles</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html\" target=\"_blank\">Game Pass Ultimate</a>, which likely won't help things going forward. Sharma is in many ways inheriting <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/2025-was-the-year-xbox-died-130000467.html\" target=\"_blank\">a broken-down car</a>.</p><p>As far as her plans go, Sharma’s email to staff that was included in Nadella's announcement is light on details. Sharma says she plans to continue developing &quot;great games,&quot; wants to &quot;recommit&quot; to core Xbox fans and &quot;invent new business models and new ways to play.&quot; Whether that’s enough to turn Xbox's fortunes around remains to be seen.<br /><br /><strong>Update, February 20, 4:52PM ET:</strong> Added statement from Phil Spencer shared on X.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-head-phil-spencer-is-leaving-microsoft-212838419.html?src=rss",
