The studio worked with Dutch video game developer Nixxes Software, which Sony acquired in 2021 to help bring PlayStation games to PCs. The sequel to the first <em>Death Stranding</em> is set in Australia almost a year after the events of the original game. It still features a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by strange creatures, and you’ll still control Sam Porter Bridges to connect survivors in the continent to the chiral network communications system. </p><p>Kojima Production says the PC version of the game will come with a bunch of improvements, will work with NVIDIA, AMD and Intel Upscaler and FrameGen, and will have uncapped framerates. It will support 4K gaming and will come with support for ultrawide monitors with 21:9 aspect ratio, as well as for super ultrawidescreen monitors with 32:9 aspect ratio for PC. When it comes to audio, the PC version of the game supports 3D audio via Dolby Access and DTS Sound Unbound, as well as Windows Sonic for headphones. You can play using a mouse and a keyboard if you wish, but you can also play with a DualSense controller.</p><p>You’ll be able to pre-purchase<em> Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> starting today for $70 on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-pc-march-19/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> or <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-7773ec\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games</a> and receive extra in-game items.

Some air fryers are designed for small kitchens or single servings, while others offer larger capacities and preset cooking modes for roasting, reheating or dehydrating.

Whether you’re replacing an older unit or trying one for the first time, these picks focus on appliances that are easy to live with and deliver crisp food without the need for deep frying.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-air-fryers-for-2026\">Best air fryers for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-does-an-air-fryer-do\">What does an air fryer do?</h2> \n<p>Let’s clear one thing up first: it’s not frying. Not really. Air fryers are more like smaller convection bake ovens, ones that are often pod-shaped. Most work by combining a heating element and fan, which means the hot air can usually better crisp the outside of food than other methods. They often reach higher top temperatures than toaster ovens – which is part of the appeal.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>For most recipes, a thin layer of oil (usually sprayed) helps to replicate that fried look and feel better. However, it will rarely taste precisely like the deep-fried or pan frying version when it comes out of the air fryer basket. Don’t let that put you off, though, because the air fryer, in its many forms, combines some of the best parts of other cooking processes and brings them together into an energy-efficient way of air fryer cooking dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-buying-guide-for-air-fryers\">Buying guide for air fryers</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-convection-ovens\">Convection ovens</h3> \n<p>You can separate most of these machines into two types of air fryers, and each has different pros and cons. Convection ovens are usually ovens with air fryer functions and features. They might have higher temperature settings to ensure that food crisps and cooks more like actually fried food. Most convection ovens are larger than dedicated air fryers, defeating some of the purpose of those looking to shrink cooking appliance surface area. Still, they are often more versatile with multiple cooking functions, and most have finer controls for temperatures, timings and even fan speed.</p> \n<p>You may never need a built-in oven if you have a decent convection oven. They often have the volume to handle roasts, entire chickens or tray bakes, and simply cook more, capacity-wise, making them more versatile than the pod-shaped competition.</p> \n<p>The flip side of that is that you’ll need counter space in the kitchen to house them. It also means you can use traditional oven accessories, like baking trays or cake tins, that you might already own.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-pod-shaped-air-fryers\">Pod-shaped air fryers</h3> \n<p>Pod-shaped air fryers are what you imagine when you think “air fryer.” They look like a cool, space-age kitchen gadget, bigger than a kettle but smaller than a toaster oven. Many use a drawer to hold ingredients while cooking, usually a mesh sheet or a more solid, non-stick tray with holes to allow the hot air to circulate. With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat and airflow to everything.</p> \n<p>That’s one of a few caveats. This type of air fryer typically doesn't have a window to see how things are cooking (with only a few exceptions), so you’ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. Basket-style air fryers also generally use less energy – there’s less space to heat – and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher.</p> \n<p>Some of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of tasty chicken wings or tenders while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries or veggies for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they’re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere.</p> \n<p>As mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you’ll have to pay for them.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/fcbb58a0-a9d4-11ec-97f7-1be0d263a8a8\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-air-fryer-pros-and-cons\">Air fryer pros and cons</h2> \n<p>Beyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you’ll be air frying, so even beginners can master these machines.</p> \n<p>One of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings, frozen foods and other delights with less fat than other methods like deep frying, which gets foods the crispiest. As air fryers work by circulating heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat and crisper food when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with vegetable oil. If you don’t, there’s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a dash of oil spray when you turn items during cooking.</p> \n<p>Most air fryers are easy to clean – especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We’ll get into cleaning guidance a little later.</p> \n<p>With a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient for cooking food than larger appliances like ovens. And if you don’t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable – especially the pod options.</p> \n<p>There are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest types of food – like chicken nuggets, frozen French fries or brussels sprouts. If you’re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can – and will – affect cooking.</p> \n<p>There’s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS – there’s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you’ll probably want to go for a large capacity air fryer – possibly one that has multiple cooking areas. You also might want to consider a different kitchen appliance, like a multicooker, sous vide or slow cooker to meet your specific cooking needs.</p> \n<p>You may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it’s cooked right through. If you’re planning to cook a whole chicken or a roast, please get a meat thermometer!</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-air-fryer-accessories\">Best air fryer accessories</h2> \n<p>Beyond official accessories from the manufacturer, try to pick up silicone-tipped tools. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B08RHQ5S95&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8dfb0e35-0d59-41ac-a6cd-b9af5a4bdad8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Tongs&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NpbGljb25lLU5vbi1TdGljay1SZXNpc3RhbnQtR3JpbGxpbmctVG9ydGlsbGFzL2RwL0IwOFJIUTVTOTU_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGRmYjBlMzUtMGQ1OS00MWFjLWE2Y2QtYjlhZjVhNGJkYWQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NpbGljb25lLU5vbi1TdGljay1SZXNpc3RhbnQtR3JpbGxpbmctVG9ydGlsbGFzL2RwL0IwOFJIUTVTOTUiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUPuXbF4SKrJD7HqCUdz2gVav2-m2vB7sAFn3UNnuwHn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSilicone-Non-Stick-Resistant-Grilling-Tortillas%2Fdp%2FB08RHQ5S95\">Tongs</a> are ideal, as is a silicon spatula to gently loosen food that might get stuck on the sides of the air fryer.

Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away the non-stick coating. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely.</p> \n<p>Remove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe – and you have a dishwasher – the job is pretty much done.</p> \n<p>Otherwise, hand wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any crumbs, greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us.</p> \n<p>Take a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers – use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides.</p> \n<p>If Dawn isn’t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn’t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-find-air-fryer-recipes\">How to find air fryer recipes</h2> \n<p>Beyond fries, nuggets and – a revelation – frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for air-fried foods. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however.</p> \n<p>Many of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there’s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words “air fryer” on the end of the search string. We’ve picked up some reliable options from <em>Delish</em>, which also has a handy air fryer time <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/cookware-reviews/a35686392/air-fryer-conversion/\">converter</a> for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes. <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/air-fryer-recipes\"><em>BBC Good Food</em></a> is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Nvb2tpbmcubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGZiMGUzNS0wZDU5LTQxYWMtYTZjZC1iOWFmNWE0YmRhZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQlYZaY4TNa78tVAt9mFUeOlSWHXXGjsrTSZXBwIMML9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcooking.nytimes.com%2F\">NYT Cooking</a>, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions. Aside from that, you can also grab plenty of cookbooks from your local bookshop with lots of recipes that you can use in your favorite air fryer.</p> \n<p>And if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What’s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake? We’re ready to try it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-air-fryers\">How we test air fryers</h2> \n<p>We put each air fryer we test through its paces by cooking a variety of foods in it including raw proteins like fish and chicken, raw vegetables like potatoes and cauliflower and frozen snacks like mozzarella sticks. We attempt to use each cooking method that the machine has pre-programmed, and when possible, follow a couple of recipes in any provided recipe booklets that come with the air fryer. We also clean the cooking basket and all other removable components as many times as possible, and will put those components into a dishwasher if they claim to be dishwasher-safe. We also make note of how loud the machine is when using different cooking settings and how warm the surrounding area becomes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss",

Now, at the tail end of that 20th anniversary celebration, Sony’s Santa Monica Studio has announced two new project. First, and most significantly, the original God of War trilogy from the PS2 and PS3 is being remade for the modern era. </p><p>There’s no footage of it yet — the developer says that they’re “very early in development,” so we likely won’t see or hear much about this for a while. But given renewed interest in God of War thanks to the excellent two Norse games from 2018 and 2022 (not to mention the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/ryan-hurst-cast-as-kratos-for-live-action-god-of-war-show-211655396.html\" target=\"_blank\">upcoming Amazon series</a>), it makes sense to revisit these classics. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>God of War</em> and <em>God of War II</em> were released for Playstation 2 in 2005 and 2007, respectively, while the third of the Greek trilogy hit PlayStation 3 in 2010. The third game was also remastered for the PS4. But it’s safe to say that while the first two games are classics for their era, they also really show their age in some gameplay spots. Hopefully the remake will smooth out those rough edges. (Who else has nightmares in the Hades level near the end of the first game? Not just me, right?)</p><p>While we won’t see the remakes for a while, there <em>is</em> a new God of War-inspired game out right now: <em>God of War Sons of Sparta</em>. It was developed by Mega Cat Studios, a developer known for its love of retro games — it even still releases games for the SNES and Genesis. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Given their pedigree, it’s no surprise that <em>Sons of Sparta</em> has vibes of classic 2D action/platformer games. It’s apparently canon for the series and takes place in Kratos’ youth while he trains with his brother. It obviously looks nothing like the other God of War games — but the combat and monsters shown off in the trailer definitely feel right at home in the series. </p><p>Perhaps the most fun part of all this is that it’s available today for $30. While <em>Sons of Sparta</em> looks like a fun curio for God of War fans, it’ll only go so far towards whetting our appetite for that remake series.

In recent years, it’s been possible to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQHZeCjVGIY\" target=\"_blank\">emulate the game on a powerful PC</a>, but not everyone has that kind of hardware.    </p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2  </em>will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p><strong>Update, February 12, 6:30PM ET: </strong>This story was updated after publish to add details about <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2</em>’s launch platforms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-next-metal-gear-solid-remaster-collection-arrives-this-summer-231711005.html?src=rss",

At today’s State of Play event, we got to see the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/new-gameplay-details-on-control-resonants-supernatural-action/\" target=\"_blank\">first extended bit of gameplay</a> from <em>Control Resonant</em> — and the combat looks as inspired as ever, though the setting is completely new.</p><p>As we learned in December, the next <em>Control</em> games doesn’t focus on Jesse Faden; instead, you’ll primarily play as her brother Dylan who Jesse was trying to find for much of the first game. Dylan’s out in a warped version of New York City trying to track the game’s Resonant creatures that are responsible for whatever calamity has taken place. We knew this already, but the change of setting from the Bureau of Control building into the more open city setting should go a long way towards making this game feel fresh. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Dylan’s capabilities are also completely different than what we saw from Jesse in the original. There’s a much bigger emphasis on melee combat, as Dylan has a shapeshifting weapon called the Aberrant. You can switch from hammer to blades to other various forms, much in the way that Jesse’s firearm in the first game could morph between different types of guns. </p><p>But the thing that stood out the most to me in the brief preview was the way that NYC completely disobeyed the laws of physics.

As in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, you’ll be able to play the mode with up to three other people online. Players can each choose from one of four classes — samurai, archer, mercenary and shinobi — who excel in different combat scenarios. All four classes can wield a katana and bow, but then they also have access to special weapons and skills. For example,  the samurai can wield the odachi, giving them a sweeping move set against groups of enemies.  You’ll need to use teamwork and your class’s abilities to take down demonic versions of the Yotei Six. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>The mode will arrive alongside the game’s 1.5 patch, and will be free for all <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>owners<em>. </em>At launch,<em> </em>players can look forward to three different mission types. In survival, you’ll be tasked with fighting off increasingly difficult enemies. In story mode, meanwhile, you and one other player will need to complete a series of 12 missions to unlock the expansion’s incursion mode, which will see you siege a fortress belonging to a member of Yotei Six. At first, there will be four strongholds for players to conquer, with a later April patch adding the final bosses. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ghost-of-yoteis-multiplayer-expansion-arrives-march-10-223842684.html?src=rss",

Gail Slater, a former JD Vance adviser and Fox Corp VP, reportedly clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Their longstanding feud is said to have centered around Slater's skepticism of corporate mergers.</p><p>&quot;It is with great sadness and abiding hope that I leave my role as [Assistant Attorney General] for Antitrust today,&quot; Slater <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/gailaslater/status/2021975634445304262\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on X. &quot;It was indeed the honor of a lifetime to serve in this role.&quot;</p><p>Although Slater technically resigned, <em>The Guardian</em> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/12/us-antitrust-gail-slater-ousted-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that she was forced out. The fallout was said to be over her differences with Bondi (who just yesterday <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/pam-bondi-hearing-congress-democrats-epstein\" target=\"_blank\">yelled, insulted and deflected</a> her way through a hearing over the DOJ's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/09/jamie-raskin-doj-cover-up-epstein-files\" target=\"_blank\">stonewalling</a> of the Epstein files).

She opposed the deal out of concerns that it would create a duopoly in cloud computing and wireless networking. In addition, Slater reportedly told Bondi that US intelligence hadn't raised any concerns about blocking the merger. However, CIA Director John Ratcliffe later <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/30/merger-hpe-juniper-networks-national-security\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> that blocking it would pose national security risks because it could lead to the loss of business to China. The Trump administration's merger-friendly DOJ ultimately approved the deal.</p><p>Alongside Bondi, Slater was overseeing the DOJ's review of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery</a>. In December, Trump said he would be involved in the regulatory review. That followed intense lobbying by Netflix and Paramount, the latter of which launched a hostile takeover bid. Earlier this month, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that the department was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/doj-is-investigating-if-netflix-used-anticompetitive-tactics-as-part-of-its-merger-probe-210940856.html\" target=\"_blank\">investigating whether Netflix was involved</a> in anticompetitive practices during the process.</p><p>Slater's ousting also comes weeks ahead of the DOJ's antitrust trial against Ticketmaster owner Live Nation. The department's lawsuit was filed during the Biden administration. It claims that Live Nation is operating as a monopoly, harming competition, fans, industry promoters and artists.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/antitrust-head-overseeing-netflix-warner-merger-resigns-192854114.html?src=rss",

This week, they made good on those threats. According to <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/at-least-1200-ubisoft-workers-strike-in-response-to-recent-restructuring\"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>, union members confirmed that at least 1,200 staff participated in the three-day strike, which was due to run from February 10 to February 12.</p>\n<p>While the strike action primarily took place in France, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>was told that Ubisoft’s Milan office also took part. The union Solidaires Informatique, which represents French workers from a number of companies in the video game sector, including Blizzard and Ubisoft, had previously <a href=\"https://x.com/SolInfoJeuVideo/status/1615263954955116546/photo/2\">called</a> for strikes to take place on January 27. Their demands included a 10 percent increase on all salaries and the implementation of a 4-day work week.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Some striking employees held up signs outside Ubisoft’s Paris headquarters, with one (pictured) wearing a Rabbids mask to hide their face. Their grievances are wide-ranging. As well as <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-proposes-even-more-layoffs-after-last-weeks-studio-closures-and-game-cancellations-192703241.html\">reportedly</a> laying off hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/star-wars-outlaws-developer-massive-entertainment-and-ubisoft-stockholm-face-layoffs-134234968.html\">employees</a> already in 2026, Ubisoft also introduced a <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/dont-call-it-a-layoff-ubisoft-issues-a-full-return-to-office-order-for-all-employees-as-it-confirms-more-studio-closures-are-coming/\">mandate</a> for its staff to return to work on site for five days a week. One employee who publicly voiced their disapproval of the new policy was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-fires-employee-who-publicly-criticized-its-rto-plan-220913747.html\">reportedly</a> fired for doing so.</p>\n<p>Ubisoft has had a rocky start to 2026 on the software side too. The long-awaited <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </em>remake was among six games <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-among-six-games-canceled-by-ubisoft-175801132.html\">canceled</a> by the struggling publisher last month, when it also confirmed several studio closures as part of the company’s organizational restructuring.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, Feb. 12 2026, 12:39PM ET:  </strong>&quot;We understand these changes, particularly those affecting work organization, are generating strong feelings,&quot; Ubisoft wrote in a statement shared with Engadget. &quot;Since the announcement, we have held a series of discussions and information sessions at multiple levels to help teams better understand the new organization and to give them the opportunity to share their questions and concerns.&quot; The company added that it &quot;remains committed to maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with employees and employee representatives.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/1200-ubisoft-workers-went-on-strike-in-response-to-company-restructuring-and-mandatory-return-to-work-policy-163714986.html?src=rss",

The sale applies to all three colorways.</p> \n<p>These easily topped our list of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">best wireless headphones</a>. They are, in a word, fantastic. The headphones are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html\">packed with premium features</a>, like advanced ANC. There are a whopping 12 ANC microphones throughout and a brand-new chip to power the feature. The end result? It successfully blocks background noise at medium and high frequencies, including the human voice.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction.</p> \n<p>The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The only real major nitpick here is the original asking price. It's tough to recommend any pair of headphones for $460, but a bit easier at under $400.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/our-favorite-wireless-headphones-are-down-to-a-record-low-price-175038190.html?src=rss",

Case in point: this new Disney+ deal.

That's $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> \n<p>We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year.

Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-disney-hulu-bundle-is-down-to-only-10-for-one-month-192814350.html?src=rss",

It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> \n<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> \n<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-elevation-labs-10-year-extended-battery-case-for-airtag-for-only-16-for-presidents-day-151215232.html?src=rss",

Russian authorities removed the app from an online directory, effectively wiping it from Russia's internet. The government has previously said that it wants users to switch to an app called Max, an unencrypted WeChat clone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;Today the Russian government has attempted to fully block WhatsApp in an effort to drive users to a state-owned surveillance app,&quot; Meta told the <em>FT</em> in a statement. &quot;Trying to isolate over 100 million people from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Russian government deleted WhatsApp rival Telegram yesterday, while also erasing Meta apps Facebook and Instagram. YouTube access was also reportedly degraded, though it's not clear if the app has been completely removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In July 2025, a Russian lawmaker who regulates the IT industry said it's very likely that WhatsApp would be placed on a list of restricted software. Parent Meta has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/russian-court-bans-instagram-and-facebook-but-wont-kick-out-whatsapp-004629924.html\">designated as an extremist organization</a> in Russia, and last year Vladimir Putin issued a directive for the nation to further restrict communication apps originating from &quot;unfriendly countries&quot; that have sanctioned Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The state has said that an in-house app would protect citizens from fraud and terrorism, given the large number of scammers on WhatsApp in the nation. However, restrictions on Telegram haven't gone over well domestically, even among Putin's allies, as residents along Ukraine's borders have relied on it for drone and missile alerts. &quot;I am concerned that slowing Telegram could affect the flow of&nbsp;information, if the situation deteriorates,&quot; said the governor of one of those regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/whatsapp-is-now-fully-blocked-in-russia-110953485.html?src=rss",

The company has reportedly acquired the show’s IP and all rights from its original studio, Fifth Season, back in December in a deal that was worth approximately $70 million. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer, but Apple Studios will now be in charge of the show. <em>Severance</em> will be one of Apple’s marquee titles, alongside other shows like Owen Wilson’s <em>Stick</em> and Kristen Wiig’s <em>Palm Royale</em>. Apple also previously acquired sci-fi dystopian series <em>Silo</em> after its first season.</p><p><em>Deadline</em> reports that the show’s production costs were going beyond what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already asked Apple for advances in the past and was considering moving the production from New York to Canada for bigger tax rebates. Apple has also apparently been helping Fifth Season not just with its budget, but also with securing advertisers. </p><p>Seeing as the second season of <em>Severance</em> became the streamer’s <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/02/severance-ratings-season-2-apple-most-watched-series-1236294760/\" target=\"_blank\">most watched series</a>, and Apple definitely has the money to keep the show going, the company decided to take over the series completely. It will allow <em>Severance’s</em> production to stay in New York without having to worry about budget constraints. <em>Deadline</em> says the series is expected to have four seasons, with the spinoffs showrunner Dan Erickson and director Ben Stiller are open to now being in the realm of possibility. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-acquires-severance-and-will-produce-future-seasons-in-house-092405747.html?src=rss",
