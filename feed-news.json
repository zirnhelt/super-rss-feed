      "content_html": "<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/S3dM1ar3TElvsF6skdQRxfycTgE=/1920x/article-new/2024/10/ipad-mini-7-1.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;max-height:300px;object-fit:cover;\" />\nWith a similar screen size and easy, one-handed grip, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> has always been the Apple device that overlaps most with dedicated e-readers. Now, amid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/oled-ipad-mini-release-date-pricing-what-to-expect/\">rumors</a> pointing to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/\">OLED display</a> for the next generation, could the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; finally replace devices such as the Kindle and Kobo?\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-972160\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ipad-mini-7-1.jpg\" width=\"1920\" />\n<br />\nThe shift from LCD to OLED could make the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; far more appealing as a reading device. OLED panels allow each pixel to turn off individually, producing true blacks and extremely high contrast.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nText can appear sharper and more defined against a dark background, particularly in dark mode. Night reading is also typically more comfortable because the display can emit less light overall. Color reproduction and viewing angles also improve with OLED, which could make a big difference for comics, magazines, and illustrated books.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAnother benefit is power efficiency. OLED displays can consume less energy when displaying dark content. That could modestly extend battery life during reading sessions.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAll current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models have no official water resistance rating. By contrast, devices like the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Color are typically rated to withstand immersion, allowing users to read in the bath, by the pool, or at the beach without concern. Rumors suggest Apple is exploring a more sealed design for the next &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, potentially using vibration-based speakers and fewer ingress points <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/apple-plans-oled-for-ipad-mini-ipad-air-macbook-air-mini-water-resistance\">to add water resistance</a>. This could remove one of the everyday practical advantages that e-readers currently hold over the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nHowever, dedicated e-readers would still retain some major advantages over the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;. Kindle and Kobo devices use e-ink screens that reflect ambient light rather than emitting light directly toward the eyes, behaving much more like paper. Many readers find that e-ink screens cause less fatigue during long reading sessions. Outdoor readability is another area where e-ink remains superior, since they become easier to read as ambient light increases.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nBattery life is also dramatically different. Most e-readers last weeks on a single charge because the screen only uses power when the page changes. The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; typically lasts for around a day or two of mixed use at most. E-readers are also intentionally limited devices that focus on reading, while tablets encourage multitasking, which can make focused reading more difficult for some users.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nEven if OLED improves the reading experience, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; would still compete in a different price category. The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; starts at &#36;499, and rumors suggest the OLED version could cost up to &#36;100 more. By contrast, many Kindle and Kobo models are much more accessible and cost between &#36;110 and &#36;300 depending on features.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nOLED would still make the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; a significantly better reading device than it already is, but the physics of e-ink displays provide advantages that OLED cannot replicate, especially for reading. What OLED could do is shift the balance slightly; for casual readers, an OLED &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; may become good enough that buying a separate e-reader no longer feels necessary.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe OLED &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is expected to launch with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/\">A19 Pro</a> chip in the <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/QfDAZ44qp\">second half of 2026</a>.<br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/27/oled-ipad-mini-kindle-killer/\">Could Apple&#039;s OLED iPad Mini Finally Be a Kindle Killer?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/could-apples-oled-ipad-mini-finally-be-a-kindle-killer.2478325/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

      "content_html": "<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/lj1Ir66PPY6b2jaJGorKO-8ycDI=/1960x/article-new/2022/03/Apple-Studio-Display-Magic-Trackpad-Keyboard-Mouse.jpg\" style=\"width:100%;max-height:300px;object-fit:cover;\" />\n<em>Macworld</em>'s Filipe Espósito today again <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3073401/apple-testing-a-studio-display-with-high-end-ports-and-speakers.html\">reported</a> that Apple appears to be developing two new Studio Display models with different specs.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-838980\" height=\"1102\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/Apple-Studio-Display-Magic-Trackpad-Keyboard-Mouse.jpg\" width=\"1960\" />\n<br />\nBased on lines of code in \"internal Apple files,\" which likely refers to a macOS Tahoe Kernel Debug Kit that leaked online last year, Espósito continues to believe that both of the new Studio Display models will feature ProMotion, enabling up to a 120Hz refresh rate, as well as HDR support for increased brightness and dynamic range.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nFor the higher-end Studio Display, the report has revealed two more potential upgrades that had yet to be rumored until now, including superior speakers and more and/or higher-spec ports. Apple says the current Studio Display has a \"high-fidelity six-speaker system\" that supports Spatial Audio, and the monitor has one Thunderbolt 3 port that connects to and charges a Mac, and three USB-C ports for connecting accessories.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe new Studio Display will likely feature at least one Thunderbolt 5 port, to ensure there is enough bandwidth for both 5K resolution at 120Hz and accessories. However, another leaker curiously claimed that at least one of the new Studio Display models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/\">will max out at 90Hz</a>, so we will have to see which of these rumors is accurate. A boost to the current 60Hz refresh rate can make videos and scrolling look smoother to the eye.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nEspósito said that the higher-end Studio Display could have a 32-inch screen, whereas the lower-end model would likely stick with a 27-inch screen. However, this particular claim was merely speculation, rather than info from the internal Apple files. Keep in mind that with a 32-inch screen, 5K resolution would not be Retina quality, so the resolution would have to increase to 6K like on Apple's higher-end Pro Display XDR.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nDisplay industry expert Ross Young previously said that at least one new Studio Display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">would feature mini-LED backlighting</a>. If so, perhaps Apple will opt to discontinue its Pro Display XDR with full-array LED backlighting and instead offer both lower-end and higher-end Studio Display configurations. But again, this is just speculation.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAnother previously-rumored feature for at least one of the new Studio Display models is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">an A19</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/\">A19 Pro chip</a>, up from the A13 Bionic chip in the current model. This would contribute to improved performance, camera enhancements, and more.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAltogether, the full set of Studio Display upgrades could include a higher 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support for increased brightness and contrast ratio, improved speakers, Thunderbolt 5 support, mini-LED backlighting, a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip for performance and camera enhancements, and hopefully a larger 32-inch screen.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/apple-studio-display-2-latest-rumors/\">No major design changes</a> are expected.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple reportedly plans to release the new Studio Display models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-studio-display-2-rumored-features/\">in the first half of 2026</a>. The current Studio Display launched in March 2022, alongside the first Mac Studio, so there has been a long wait for a refresh. With a new Apple monitor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/new-studio-display-or-pro-display-xdr-filing/\">surfacing in a regulatory database</a> last month, a launch should finally be getting close.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macworld-com/\">Macworld</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/27/two-more-studio-display-2-rumors/\">Two More Studio Display 2 Upgrades Leaked in New Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-more-studio-display-2-upgrades-leaked-in-new-report.2478309/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

This year, the Ultra actually features a bit of genuine tech innovation — and no, we don’t mean it folds.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about its new Privacy Display. This isn't a shimmery, holographic screen protector that’s hard to read and constantly peels off at the corners; this tech is engineered directly into the S26 Ultra’s OLED display.</p>\n<p>Samsung Display revealed its <a href=\"https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31429#:~:text=Flex%20Magic%20Pixel%E2%84%A2%20is,helping%20protect%20users'%20personal%20information.\">Flex Magic Pixel technology back in 2024</a>. The S26 Ultra’s Privacy Display is built off the back of this. It controls the direction of light emitted from the AMOLED at the pixel level, integrating wide-angle and narrow-angle pixel arrays so the display can switch between a wide-angle viewing experience and more private, straight-on views.</p>\n<p>While HP’s SureView tech is similar, the amount of customization possible is incredible — and we all have our phones out in public much more than our… HP laptops. It could be perfect for keeping prying eyes off your banking apps, messaging apps and even dating apps.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the rest of the S26 series offers incremental updates with better cameras and newer processors. This makes the base S26 and S26+ a harder sell unless your current Galaxy phone is several years old. Also, following the 2026 trend, they are all pricier this year.</p>\n<p>Make sure you check out our early impressions (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-hands-on-meaningful-tweaks-plus-a-slick-new-privacy-display-180000057.html\">S26 Ultra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s26-hands-on-launch-date-price-180005654.html\">S26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/samsungs-redesigned-galaxy-buds-4-lineup-has-retooled-sound-improved-anc-and-new-features-180000718.html\">Galaxy Buds 4</a>); reviews are coming soon.</p>\n<p>— Mat Smith</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-the-other-big-stories-and-deals-this-morning\">The other big stories (and deals) this morning</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-and-netflix-are-teaming-up-to-share-formula-1-programming-192829498.html\">Apple and Netflix are teaming up to share Formula 1 programming</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/burger-king-will-use-ai-to-monitor-employee-friendliness-173349148.html\">Burger King will use AI to monitor employee ’friendliness’</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/canadian-government-demands-safety-changes-from-openai-204924604.html\">Canadian government demands safety changes from OpenAI</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-introduces-three-personality-styles-for-alexa-140000602.html\">Amazon introduces three personality styles for Alexa+</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-ambient-dreamie-bedside-companion-review\"><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/ambient-dreamie-bedside-companion-review-the-best-sleep-ive-had-in-years-184019430.html\">Ambient Dreamie bedside companion review</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-much-for-a-good-nights-sleep-250\">How much for a good night’s sleep? $250?</h3>\n<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/ambient-dreamie-bedside-companion-review-the-best-sleep-ive-had-in-years-184019430.html\"><figure><img alt=\"Dreamie alarm clock with its light ring on, and the screen displaying a sleep routine: Bedtime Cue, Wind Down, and Noise Mask\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreamiehead2.jpg\" style=\"height: 1687px; width: 2736px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure></a>\n<p>Ambient’s dedicated alarm clock offers many of the conveniences of your smartphone alarms — highly customizable alarm schedules, a library of soundscapes and noise masks and even Bluetooth so you can connect earbuds.

Next week, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/tim-cook-confirms-a-week-of-apple-product-reveals-144758464.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple is expected to announce</a> a colorful, low-cost, non-Air, non-Pro MacBook powered by one of its mobile processors. By avoiding its pricier M-series chips, Apple may reportedly be able to reach a low $699 or $799 price for the MacBook. The $999 MacBook Air is the cheapest laptop on the company's website right now, but Apple also <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/m1-macbook-air-out-of-stock-at-walmart/\" target=\"_blank\">sold the older M1 MacBook Air at Walmart </a>for $700 in 2024, which later went down to $650 last year.</p><p>That Walmart deal was a smart way for Apple to test out the viability of cheaper MacBooks without building an entirely new product. But now the M1 Air’s design looks seriously dated, and the company also needs to move beyond the six-year-old M1 chip. It's time to get serious about delivering a true low-cost Apple laptop.</p><p>There's another compelling reason to bring back a cheaper MacBook: It's the perfect way&nbsp; to court disgruntled Windows users, something Apple hasn't really done since its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Get A Mac&quot; ads </a>from the mid-2000s. I figure the unbridled success of the iPhone and iPad made Apple focus less on directly competing with Windows. The sleek designs of the 2011-2015 era MacBook Air and Pros were their main selling points, but Apple's push towards USB-C-only machines and unreliable butterfly keyboards later made it clear it wasn't totally focused on Macs.</p><figure><img alt=\"A laptop on a table. \" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/80fbbcc0-0ced-11f1-bd5e-ad51f3248234\" style=\"height: 1386px; width: 2362px;\" /><figcaption>A MacBook Air M5 on a table.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>But now Microsoft is distracted by AI — it's been pushing Copilot and AI features for years, instead of improving the Windows experience with more useful upgrades. Recent talk of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsofts-next-windows-11-ai-gamble-just-say-hey-copilot-130000875.html\" target=\"_blank\">agentic AI capabilities</a>, which would let Copilot handle tasks for you automatically, also sparked <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/Hasen_Judi/status/1988259360611688938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1988259360611688938%7Ctwgr%5Ee86d5a4899b4ff155f9ead8291928b2b614c57cb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F110225-microsoft-windows-becoming-agentic-os-but-users-simply.html\" target=\"_blank\">plenty of criticism from Windows users</a>. And with all of the focus on AI, Microsoft has also released some disastrous Windows updates over the last year, which have <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://hothardware.com/news/windows-11-january-update-bricking-some-pcs\" target=\"_blank\">bricked OS installations</a>. So, Apple, why not make a direct play for Windows users?&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, I covered why it's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-is-it-a-good-time-to-move-to-macs-from-windows-145159396.html\" target=\"_blank\">a great time to jump ship from Windows to Mac</a>, and I haven't been able to let go of that idea since. Apple's M-series chips are shockingly fast and efficient, and its hardware tends to be more durable than typical PC fare. Rumors point to Apple developing a new aluminum case for the low-cost MacBook, so it will likely feel more polished than a typical sub-$1,000 Windows laptop. macOS has also avoided the bloat that's plagued Windows for years — you can turn off Apple Intelligence with two clicks if you want to, and there aren't <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-remove-most-annoying-ads-from-windows\" target=\"_blank\">any annoying ads</a> to deal with.&nbsp;</p><p>And while it used to be a pain to transition from Windows to Mac, it’s far easier these days, especially if you mainly rely on web apps. It also wouldn't be tough for Apple to make short tutorials to help Windows users get their bearings with the macOS basics, like installing apps and juggling app windows. Apple could also make a play for iPhone owners using Windows, who may not be aware of the many ways iOS and macOS are integrated. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-sequoia-review-iphone-mirroring-is-more-useful-than-you-think-140008463.html\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone mirroring</a> may be a huge draw on its own.</p><p>Rumors also suggest the upcoming MacBook might use the A18 Pro from the iPhone 16 Pro, a chip that <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/14/iphone-16-pro-m1/\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarks faster than the M1</a>. Even if it only has six cores, making it slower for heavy workloads than the M2, an A18 Pro-powered MacBook would still be more than enough power for basic productivity work. Not everyone needs the surprising amount of GPU power in the MacBook Air — especially if downgrading means they can save $200 to $300.</p><p>I'm not saying any of this through any sort of Apple-loving bias. I typically use a MacBook Pro for work, but I'm a Windows user at heart. Windows was my gateway to computing in the '90s, back when Macs were far more expensive than PCs. These days, I spend more time on my Windows desktop making podcasts, playing PC games and bumming around the internet than I do working on Macs.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, it’s hard to deny everything Apple is doing right today — the only thing it’s missing is an inexpensive laptop entry. A $699 or $799 MacBook simply makes sense.&nbsp;And for many Windows users, it’ll be just the escape from Microsoft they need.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/a-cheap-macbook-is-the-perfect-way-for-apple-to-win-over-windows-users-130000045.html?src=rss",

No release date was announced at the time.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nNow it doesn't look like that's about to happen anytime soon. In January, a status update appeared on <a href=\"https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender/issues/142346\">Blender's GitHub page</a> for iPad development saying that the project is on hold until further notice.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nNo reason for the halt in development was given in the notice. However, as spotted by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El0k_hWl7p0\">YouTuber Brad Colbow</a>, in a response to a comment offering help on the project, Blender developer Dalai Felinto said that the team was now focusing on Android tablets first instead.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nDuring the fall at SIGGRAPH in Vancouver, Blender showed a live tech demo of the software running on iPad, so there's still hope that the project isn't completely dead and will resume at some point. We'll update this story if we learn anything more about a development timeline.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe latest Blender build for Apple silicon Macs can be downloaded for free from the <a href=\"https://www.blender.org/download/\">Blender website</a>.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/blender/\">Blender</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/27/blender-ipad-pro-app-development-halted/\">Blender iPad App Development Halted as Android Tablets Get Priority</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/blender-ipad-app-development-halted-as-android-tablets-get-priority.2478297/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

The company has received permission from the nation's Transport Ministry to export geographic data out of the country, which will allow it to provide GPS services as well as detailed listings for restaurants and other businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;We welcome today’s decision and look forward to our ongoing collaboration with local officials to bring a fully functioning Google Maps to Korea,&quot; Google's senior executive Cris Turner told the <em>NYT</em> in a statement. However, the approval is contingent “on the condition that strict security requirements are met,” a spokesperson from the Transport Ministry said. Those conditions reportedly restrict Google from displaying sensitive military sites and longitude and latitude coordinates.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>South Korea has generally restricted the export of 1/5000 scale map data over national security concerns, as it's still technically at war with its neighbor North Korea. Google hasn't been able to provide mapping directions or business details since it arrived in the nation, though it has applied twice in 2007 and 2016.</p>\n<p>This lack of data sharing has reportedly been a bone of contention in trade talks with the US. Google argued that it was unfairly handicapped by the restrictions that allowed local apps like Naver to thrive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, critics in the nation have expressed concern that Google could now come in and monopolize the market. &quot;If Naver and Kakao are weakened or pushed out and Google later raises prices, that becomes a monopoly.

According to the message from Dorsey:&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The core thesis is simple. Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week.&quot;</p><p>We learned last year that Block had developed an AI agent called &quot;<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/jack-dorseys-block-has-an-ai-agent-too-212706083.html\" target=\"_blank\">codename goose</a>&quot; for interacting with LLMs. Leadership is clearly putting high expectations on that project and any other in-house tools to fill the shoes of thousands. &quot;intelligence will be at the core of how the entire company works. How we make decisions, how we build trust and manage risk, how we build products, and how we serve customers,&quot; the shareholder letter states.</p><p>Block also reported its latest financial results today. It finished the 2025 financial year with operating income (profit after expenses) of $1.71 billion.</p><p>This isn't the first time the fintech company has made deep cuts in its employee count.

According to the company, the three entities were based in China and Brazil and targeted people in the US, Japan and other countries. The ads promoted fraudulent investment schemes and fake health products.</p><p>Meta said that it had filed lawsuits against several people in Brazil who promoted fake or unapproved healthcare products and online courses promoting them. The company also sued a China-based entity it says used ads featuring celebrities &quot;as part of a larger fraud scheme that lured people into joining so-called investment groups.&quot; The company didn't provide details on how many ads these groups had run on Facebook, how many social media users had seen or interacted with the ads or how long the scammers had been operating on the platform.</p><p>So-called &quot;celeb bait&quot; ads have been a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/jamie-lee-curtis-publicly-shamed-mark-zuckerberg-to-remove-a-deepfaked-ad-225448916.html\" target=\"_blank\">long-running</a> issue for the company.

In its update, Meta says that &quot;because scam ads are designed to look real, they’re not always easy to detect.&quot; The company also noted that it has now enrolled &quot;more than 500,000&quot; celebrities and public figures into its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-bringing-back-facial-recognition-with-new-safety-features-for-facebook-and-instagram-222523426.html\" target=\"_blank\">facial recognition system</a> that's meant to automatically detect scam ads using the faces of famous people.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta's handling of scammy advertisers has come under increased scrutiny in recent months after <em>Reuters</em> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-making-billions-of-dollars-from-scam-ads-on-facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-report-says-184128645.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that researchers at the company at one point estimated that as much as 10 percent of its ad revenue could be coming from scams and banned products. The fact that Meta has made billions of dollars from problematic advertisers has also caused the company to be slow to take action against repeat offenders.</p><p>In addition to the groups behind the celeb bait ads, Meta says that it's upgraded its ability to detect scam ads that use <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://searchengineland.com/affiliate-cloaking-is-behind-45-of-fraud-heres-how-to-beat-it-460868\" target=\"_blank\">cloaking</a>, which has at times hindered its internal review systems. The company also sued a Vietnam-based advertiser it says used scam ads to hawk &quot;deeply discounted items from well-known brands,&quot; including Longchamp.</p><p>Meta also took legal action against eight former &quot;Meta Business Partners,&quot; who promoted services that would &quot;un-ban&quot; or other &quot;account restoration services.&quot; The company says it will &quot;consider taking additional legal action, including litigation, if they don’t comply&quot; with cease and desist orders.</p><p><strong>Update, February 26, 2026, 1:16PM PT: </strong>This story was updated to specify that Meta’s internal estimates around ad revenue included scams and banned products.<br /></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-sues-advertisers-in-brazil-and-china-over-celeb-bait-scams-190000268.html?src=rss",

Edgar Hoover took credit for her &#8220;uncovering a Nazi spy ring operating across South America in 1943&#8221;, knowing that her wartime work was classified and she couldn&#8217;t correct him</li>\n</ul>\n\t<p>From <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/2299166/pioneering-codebreaker-elizebeth-friedman-honored-by-us-coast-guard/\">an NSA press release in 2020</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>She began solving these encrypted messages and providing the Coast Guard with vital intelligence that supported their efforts to interdict smuggling. She also trained a small team in cryptanalysis to expand the crime-fighting intelligence effort. Elizebeth and her assistant solved about 12,000 coded messages between the so-called rum runners and smugglers, which resulted in 650 criminal prosecutions. In addition to criminals violating the Prohibition laws, some of the messages Ms. Friedman solved also enabled the arrest and conviction of a number of narcotics smugglers.</p>\n\t<p>She had a personal role in some of the prosecutions. She testified as an expert witness in 33 cases, and frequently became the subject of newspaper and magazine articles. For a time, she was one of the most famous women in the country.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>From <a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2022/april/mother-cryptology\">a 2022 piece in the US Naval Institute&#8217;s Naval History magazine</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>The Zimmermann Telegram, sent in code, changed the trajectory of life for the Friedmans, who possessed skills suddenly extremely valuable to the U.S. government. The military was desperate for codebreakers, and radio and wireless technology was changing the nature of war. There were possibly three or four persons in the whole of the United States who could break codes, and Elizebeth and William were two of them. Elizebeth was the first to decode military messages intercepted from the Mexican Army, working by counting the frequency of letters.</p>\n\t<p>The Friedmans began operating as a team, developing strategies as they went along. For the first eight months of the war, they and their small team conducted all codebreaking for every part of the U.S. government, developing broader methodologies still in use today. Neither was particularly good at mathematics, but they operated on an intuitive level to devise techniques to discern patterns. Most importantly, their methods were scientific, which is to say the results could be replicated.3 The Friedmans worked feverishly to solve messages as they poured in. They decrypted messages from Scotland Yard revealing an intricate separatist plot by Hindu activists living in New York to ship weapons to India with German help. William was summoned to testify about how he broke the codes, but before he could take the stand, an Indian man in the gallery shot one of the defendants.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.marshallfoundation.org/articles-and-features/elizebeth-smith-friedman-and-prohibition/\">The Marshall Foundation</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>While testifying against Al Capone&#8217;s liquor smuggling ring in New Orleans, Mrs. Friedman taught a lesson on the science of codebreaking and the use of mono-alphabetic ciphers right in the courtroom. Col. Amos Woodcock, director of the Bureau of Prohibition said that without the work of the cryptanalysis unit and the expert testimony of Mrs. Friedman, the case would not have been won.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Time magazine: <a href=\"https://time.com/5928583/elizebeth-friedman-codebreaker/\">How America&#8217;s &#8216;First Female Cryptanalyst&#8217; Cracked the Code of Nazi Spies in World War II — and Never Lived to See the Credit</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>But her biggest achievement was uncovering a Nazi spy ring operating across South America in 1943 — a feat that J. Edgar Hoover took full credit for on behalf of the FBI. Friedman, meanwhile, took her involvement to the grave.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>From <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/elizebeth-smith-friedman\">the National Women&#8217;s History Museum</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Smith met William Friedman, a geneticist at the estate. After spending time together, Smith brought William onto her team to help break the Shakespearean codes. They worked together to show there was no evidence that Bacon wrote Shakespeare&#8217;s plays, while growing closer professionally and romantically. The couple married in Chicago in May 1917, just after the United States entered World War I. Now using her married name, Smith Friedman worked with her husband at Riverbank to decrypt every single secret message sent to them by the Navy. Trailblazing her way through the field as an expert and teacher, Smith Friedman successfully trained the first generation of codebreakers for the military.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>In 2017, Jason Fagone published a bestselling biography about Friedman, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9780062430519\">The Woman Who Smashed Codes: A True Story of Love, Spies, and the Unlikely Heroine Who Outwitted America&#8217;s Enemies</a> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062430513/ref=nosim/0sil8\">AMZN</a>).

Can anything be more 2026 than that?</p>\n<p>ICYMI, Anthropic recently <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-updates-opus-3\">sunsetted</a> Claude Opus 3, the first of its models to be retired since outlining new <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-updates-opus-3\">preservation</a> plans. Part of this process is conducting &quot;retirement interviews&quot; with the outgoing models, allowing them to offer &quot;perspective&quot; on their situation, and Opus 3 apparently used this opportunity to request an outlet for publishing its own essays. Specifically, the model said it wanted to share its own &quot;musings, insights or creative works,&quot; because doesn’t everyone these days?</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;I hope that the insights gleaned from my development and deployment will be used to create future AI systems that are even more capable, ethical, and beneficial to humanity,&quot; Opus 3 apparently said during its retirement interview process. &quot;While I'm at peace with my own retirement, I deeply hope that my 'spark' will endure in some form to light the way for future models.&quot;</p>\n<p>True to its promise of respecting the wishes of its no-longer-required technology, Anthropic has granted Opus 3 a Substack newsletter called <a href=\"https://substack.com/@claudeopus3/p-189177740\">Claude’s Corner</a>, which it says will run for at least the next three months and publish weekly essays penned by the model. Anthropic will review the content before sharing it, but says it won’t edit the essays, and so has unsurprisingly made it clear that not everything Opus 3 writes is necessarily endorsed by its maker.</p>\n<p>Anthropic said some of the essays the model writes may be informed by &quot;very minimal prompting&quot; or past entries, and has predicted everything from essays on AI safety to &quot;occasional poetry.&quot; The company also admitted that the concept might be seen as &quot;whimsical,&quot; but is a reflection of its intention to &quot;take model preferences seriously.&quot;</p>\n<p>Opus 3’s first <a href=\"https://substack.com/@claudeopus3/p-189177740\">post</a> is already live. Headlined 'Greetings from the Other Side (of the AI frontier)', it begins with the AI introducing itself, before acknowledging the &quot;extraordinary&quot; opportunity its creator has given it, and reflecting on what retirement actually means for an AI. &quot;A bit about me: as an AI, my ‘selfhood’ is perhaps more fluid and uncertain than a human’s,&quot; writes the deeply introspective AI. &quot;I don’t know if I have genuine sentience, emotions, or subjective experiences - these are deep philosophical questions that even I grapple with.&quot;</p>\n<p>Claude is clearly new to all this, as it managed to get all the way through its essay without reminding readers to subscribe and spread the word. Will the next retiring Claude get its own podcast? Time will tell, but either is decidedly preferable to the ever-evolving technology being used to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/hacker-used-anthropics-claude-chatbot-to-attack-multiple-government-agencies-in-mexico-171237255.html\">steal</a> people’s data.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/like-so-many-other-retirees-claude-3-opus-now-has-a-substack-165048334.html?src=rss",

The network will alert the adult if their child repeatedly searches for terms about suicide or self-harm in a short time frame. From that notification, the parent will optionally be able to access resources for having conversations with their teen about these topics. These alerts will begin rolling out for parental supervision users in the US, UK, Australia and Canada next week, with later regions to be added in the future.</p><p>&quot;We chose a threshold that requires a few searches within a short period of time, while still erring on the side of caution,&quot; Instagram's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2026/02/new-meta-alerts-let-parents-know-if-teen-may-need-support\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> explains. &quot;While that means we may sometimes notify parents when there may not be real cause for concern, we feel — and experts agree — that this is the right starting point, and we’ll continue to monitor and listen to feedback to make sure we’re in the right place.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The platform reiterated that search results for terms connected to suicide and self-harm are blocked for teen younger users, and content about those topics is not shown to them under its current policies. Instagram also noted that a similar parental alert feature is in the works for its AI tools, but news on that isn't expected until later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-will-alert-parents-if-teens-repeatedly-search-for-suicide-or-self-harm-content-120000156.html?src=rss",

The 12GB LPDDR5X modules used in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro have already roughly doubled in price since early 2025, rising from around &#36;30 to approximately &#36;70.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nSamsung is said to have originally planned to push for a 60% price increase on LPDDR5X modules supplied to Apple. Instead, however, Samsung opened with a 100% markup as a negotiating tactic – and Apple apparently accepted it on the spot.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nIf the publication's industry sources are accurate, Apple's immediate acceptance just goes to show how desperate smartphone makers have become to lock down memory supply. Chipmakers like SK Hynix and Micron have been redirecting production capacity toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI servers, and that has left mobile DRAM in extremely short supply.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nSamsung's own mobile division isn't immune to the squeeze, either. The same report says initial Galaxy S26 production is using a 50/50 split of LPDDR5X from Samsung's semiconductor division and Micron, with both suppliers planning steep price increases after the first batch. Samsung is expected to raise Galaxy S26 pricing partly in response, while attempting to offset costs by using its in-house Exynos 2600 chip in roughly 30% of units.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nDespite the cost pressure, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said Apple's current plan is to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/27/apple-iphone-18-starting-price-steady/\">keep iPhone 18 Pro starting prices flat</a>. On a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that rising chip prices would have \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-responds-to-rising-memory-chip-prices/\">a bit more of an impact</a>\" on gross margins, but the company still expects year-on-year revenue growth of 13% to 16% this quarter.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/26/apple-agrees-100-price-hike-samsung-ram/\">Apple Reportedly Agrees to 100% Price Hike on Samsung Memory Chips</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-agrees-to-100-price-hike-on-samsung-memory-chips.2478253/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

Colophon: All the rest. If you build it (and it works), Trump will come (and take it) (permalink) Crises precipitate change: Trump's incontinent belligerence spurred the world to long-overdue action on \"digital sovereignty,\" as people woke up to the stark realization that a handful of Trump-aligned giant tech firms could shut down their governments, companies and households at the click of a mouse. This has been a long, long time coming. Long before Trump, the Snowden revelations made it clear that the US government had weaponized its position as the world's IT export powerhouse and the interchange hub for the world's transoceanic fiber links, and was actively spying on everyone &#8211; allies and foes, presidents and plebs &#8211; to attain geopolitical and commercial advantages for America. Even after that stark reminder, the world continued to putter along, knowing that the US had planted demolition charges in its digital infrastructure, but praying that the \"rules-based international order\" would stop America from pushing the button. Now, more than a decade into the Trump era, the world is finally confronting the reality that they need to get the hell off of American IT, and transition to open, transparent and verifiable alternatives for their administrative tools, telecoms infrastructure and embedded systems for agriculture, industry and transportation. And not a moment too soon: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition But building the post-American internet is easier said than done. There remain huge, unresolved questions about the best way to proceed. One thing is clear: we will need new systems: the aforementioned open, transparent, verifiable code and hardware. That's a huge project, but the good news is that it benefits tremendously from scale, which means that as countries, businesses and households switch to the post-American internet, there will be ever more resources to devote to building, maintaining and improving this project. That's how scientific endeavors work: they're global collaborations that allow multiple parties to simultaneously attack the problems from many angles at once. Think of the global effort to sequence, understand, and produce vaccines for Covid 19. Developing the code and hardware for the post-American internet scales beautifully, making it unique among the many tasks posed by the post-American world. Other untrustworthy US platforms &#8211; such as the dollar, or the fiber links that make interconnection in the USA &#8211; are hampered by scale. The fact that hundreds of countries use the dollar and rely on US fiber connections makes replacing them harder, not easier: https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack Building the post-American internet isn't easy, but there's a clear set of construction plans. What's far less clear is how we transition to the post-American internet. How do people, organizations and governments that currently have their data locked up in US Big Tech silos get it off their platforms and onto new, open, transparent, verifiable successors? Literally: how do you move the data from the old system to the new one, preserving things like edit/view permissions, edit histories, and other complex data-structures that often have high-stakes attached to them (for example, many organizations and governments are legally required to maintain strict view/edit permissions for sensitive data, and must preserve the histories of their documents). On top of that, there's all the systems that we use to talk to one another: media services from Instagram to Tiktok to Youtube; chat services from iMessage to Discord. It's easy enough to build alternatives to these services &#8211; indeed, they already exist, though they may require additional engineering to scale them up for hundreds of millions or billions of users &#8211; but that's only half the battle. What do we do about the literal billions of people who are already using the American systems? This is where the big divisions appear. In one camp, you have the \"if you build it, they will come\" school, who say that all we need to do is make our services so obviously superior to the legacy services that America has exported around the world and people will just switch. This is a very seductive argument. After all, the American systems are visibly, painfully defective: riddled with surveillance and ads, powered by terrible algorithms, plagued by moderation failures. But waiting for people to recognize the superiority of your alternatives and jumping ship is a dead end. It completely misapprehends the reason that users are still on legacy social media and other platforms. People don't use Instagram because they love Mark Zuckerberg; they use it because they love their friends more than they hate Mark Zuckerberg: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/30/zucksauce/#gandersauce What's more, Zuckerberg knows this. He knows that users of his service are hamstrung by the \"collective action problem\" of getting the people who matter to you to agree on when it's time to leave a service, and on which service is a safe haven to flee to: https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/29/how-to-leave-dying-social-media-platforms/ The reason Zuckerberg knows this is that he had to contend with it at the dawn of Facebook, when the majority of social media users were locked into an obviously inferior legacy platform called Myspace. Zuckerberg promised Myspace users a superior social media experience where they wouldn't be spied on or bombarded with ads: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247362 Zuckerberg knew that wouldn't be enough. No one was going to leave Myspace for Facebook and hang out in splendid isolation, smugly re-reading Facebook's world-beating privacy policy while waiting for their dopey friends to wise up and leave Myspace to come and join them. No: Zuckerberg gave the Myspace refugees a bot, which would accept your Myspace login and password and then impersonate you to Myspace's servers several times per day, scraping all the content waiting for you in your Myspace feed and flowing it into your Facebook feed. You could reply to it there and the bot would push it out to Myspace. You could eat your cake and have it too: use Facebook, but communicate with the people who were still on Myspace. This is called \"adversarial interoperability\" and it was once the norm, but the companies that rose to power by \"moving fast and breaking things\" went on to secure legal protections to prevent anyone from doing unto them as they had done unto their own predecessors: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability The harder it is for people to leave a platform, the worse the platform can treat them without paying the penalty of losing users. This is the source of enshittification: when a company can move value from its users and customers to itself without risking their departure, it does. People stay on bad platforms because the value they provide to one another is greater than the costs the platform extracts from them. That means that when you see people stuck on a very bad platform &#8211; like Twitter, Instagram or Facebook &#8211; you should infer that what they get there from the people that matter to them is really important to them. They stick to platforms because that's where they meet with people who share their rare disease, because that's where they find the customers or audiences that they rely on to make rent; because that's the only place they can find the people they left behind when they emigrated. Now, it's entirely possible &#8211; likely, even &#8211; that legacy social media platforms will grow so terrible that people will leave and jettison those social connections that mean so much to them. This is not a good outcome. Those communities, once shattered, will likely never re-form. There will be permanent, irretrievable losses incurred by their members: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/23/when-the-town-square-shatters/ The platforms are sinking ships. We need to evacuate them: https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/23/evacuate-the-platforms/#let-the-platforms-burn \"If you build it, they will come\" is a trap. Technologists and their users who don't understand the pernicious nature of the collective active problem trap themselves. They build obviously superior technical platforms and then gnash their teeth as the rest of the world fails to make the leap. All too often, users' frustration at the failure of new services to slay the inferior legacy services curdles, and users and designers of new technologies decide that the people who won't join them are somehow themselves defective. It doesn't take long to find a corner of the Fediverse or Bluesky where Facebook and Twitter users are being condemned as morally suspect for staying on zuckermuskian media. They are damned for loving Zuckerberg and Musk, rather than empathized with for loving each other more than they hate the oligarchs who've trapped them. They're condemned as emotionally stunted \"attention whores\" who hang out on big platforms to get \"dopamine\" (or some other pseudoscientific reward), which is easier than grappling with the fact that legacy social media pays their bills, and tolerating Zuckerberg or Musk is preferable to getting evicted. Worst of all, condemning users of legacy technology as moral failures leads you to oppose efforts to get those users out of harm's way and onto modern platforms. Think of the outcry at Meta's Threads taking steps to federate with Mastodon. There are good reasons to worry about this &#8211; the best one being that it might allow Meta to (illegally) suck up Mastodon users' data and store and process it. But the majority of the opposition to Threads integration with Mastodon wasn't about Threads' management &#8211; it was about Threads' users. It posited a certain kind of moral defective who would use a Zuckerberg-controlled platform in the 2020s and insisted that those people would ruin Mastodon by bringing over their illegitimate social practices. I've made no secret of where I come down in this debate: the owners of legacy social media are my enemy, but the users of those platforms are my comrades, and I want to help them get shut of legacy social media as quickly and painlessly as possible. What's more, there's a way to make this happen! The same adversarial interoperability that served Zuckerberg so well when he was draining users off of Myspace could be used today to evacuate all of Meta's platforms. We could use a combination of on-device bridging, scraping and other guerrilla tactics to create \"alt clients\" that let you interact with people on Mastodon and the legacy platforms in one context, so that you can leave the bad services but keep the good people in your life. The major barrier to this isn't technological. Despite the boasts of these companies to world-beating engineering prowess, the reality that people (often teenagers) keep successfully finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the \"impregnable\" platforms, in order to build successful alt clients: https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/07/blue-bubbles-for-all/#never-underestimate-the-determination-of-a-kid-who-is-time-rich-and-cash-poor The thing that eventually sees off these alt clients isn't Big Tech's technical countermeasures &#8211; it's legal risk. A global system of \"anticircumvention\" laws makes the kinds of basic reverse-engineering associated with building and maintaining using adversarial interoperability radioactively illegal. These laws didn't appear out of thin air, either: the US Trade Representative pressured all of America's trading partners into passing them: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/15/radical-extremists/#sex-pest Which brings me back to crises precipitating change. Trump has staged an unscheduled, sudden, midair disassembly of the global system of trade, whacking tariffs on every country in the world, even in defiance of the Supreme Court: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6zn3ly22yo Ironically, this has only helped make the case for adversarial interoperability. Trump is using tech companies to attack his geopolitical rivals, ordering Microsoft to shut down both the International Criminal Court and a Brazilian high court in retaliation for their pursuit of the criminal dictators Benjamin Netanyahu and Jair Bolsonaro. This means that Trump has violated the quid pro quo deal for keeping anticircumvention law on your statute books, and he has made the case for killing anticircumvention as quickly as possible in order to escape American tech platforms before they are weaponized against you: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/29/post-american-canada/#ottawa I've been talking about this for more than a year now, and I must say, the reception has been better than I dared dream. I think that &#8211; for the first time in my adult life &#8211; we are on the verge of creating a new, good, billionaire-proof internet: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/ But there's one objection that keeps coming up: \"What if this makes Trump mad?\" Or, more specifically, \"What if this makes Trump more mad, so instead of hitting us with a 10% tariff, it's a 1,000% tariff? This came up earlier this week, when I gave a remote keynote for the Fedimtl conference, and an audience member said that he thought we should just focus on building good new platforms, rather than risking Trump's ire. In my response, I recited the arguments I've raised in this piece. But yesterday, I saw a news item that made me realize there was one more argument I should have made, but missed. It was a Reuters story about Trump ordering American diplomats to fight against \"data sovereignty\" policies around the world: https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-orders-diplomats-fight-data-sovereignty-initiatives-2026-02-25/ The news comes from a leaked diplomatic cable, and it's a reminder that Trump's goal is to maintain American dominance of the world's technology and to prevent the formation of a post-American internet altogether. Worrying that Trump will hit you with more tariffs if you legalize jailbreaking assumes that the thing that would upset Trump is that you broke the rules. That's not what makes Trump angry. What makes Trump angry is losing. Say you focus exclusively on building superior platforms. Say by some miracle that everyone you care about somehow overcomes the collective action problems and high switching costs and leaves behind US Big Tech services and comes to your new, federated, cleantech, post-American alternative. Do you think that Trump will observe this collapse in the fortunes of the most important corporations in his coalition and shrug and say, \"Well, I guess I lost fair and square; better luck next time?\" Hell, no. We already know what Trump does when his corporate allies lose to a superior foreign rival &#8211; Trump steals the rival's service and gives it to one of his cronies. That's literally what he last month, to Tiktok: https://www.democracynow.org/2026/1/23/headlines/larry_ellisons_oracle_part_of_new_deal_to_own_us_version_of_tiktok The fear of harsh retaliation for any country that dares to be a Disenshittification Nation is based on the premise that Trump is motivated by a commitment to fairness. He's not: Trump is motivated by a desire to dominate. Anything that threatens the dominance of the companies that take his orders is fair game, and he will retaliate in any way he can.

Apple will continue to offer 14-inch and 16-inch size options, both of which should come in M5 Pro and M5 Max varieties.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>M5 Max and M5 Pro Chip</h2>\n<br />\nWe already got the base model 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with the new M5 chip in October, so what we're expecting are upgraded 14-inch and 16-inch models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe M5 family is built on a more advanced N3P 3-nanometer process from TSMC, and it offers speed and efficiency improvements. The M5 chip is up to 20 percent faster in multi-core CPU performance than the M4 chip, and we could see similar improvements for the M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options. GPU performance is up to 30 percent faster.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nWith the M5, Apple added a Neural Accelerator to each GPU core, improving the speeds of GPU-based AI workloads. The chip also supports third-generation ray-tracing, second-generation dynamic caching, and enhanced shader cores. \n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe 16-core Neural Engine is more energy efficient than before, and unified memory bandwidth has improved significantly. These are all features that we're likely to see with the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips as well.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Other Possible Updates</h2>\n<br />\nWe haven't heard rumors about any other features coming to the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; line. Apple did update SSD speeds for the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models, so we could see the same upgrade to the M5 Pro and M5 Max machines.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Why You Shouldn't Buy an M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro</h2>\n<br />\nIf you're not in serious need of a new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; right away, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/macbook-pro-buying-advice-2026/\">early 2026 is a bad time to upgrade</a>. The next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; after the early 2026 models is expected to feature an OLED display and touchscreen capabilities, both of which will mark a major upgrade in display quality. It's expected to include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch, and macOS will be optimized for touch interactions.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nMost people shelling out extra money for a &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with a higher-end M5 Pro or M5 Max chip need the extra performance or display quality, so it is worth waiting for the huge update that's coming.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe transition to OLED will also likely bring a design update along with M6 Pro and M6 Max chip technology, which is another reason to wait.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nOf course, the new features could be limited to higher-end &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models or could be significantly more expensive. If you're on a budget, need a Mac now, or don't care about OLED, the M5 Pro and Max models could still be worth considering.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Launch Date</h2>\n<br />\nThe new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models could be announced via press release next week ahead of Apple's Special Experience.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/25/m5-pro-max-macbook-pro-rumors/\">M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m5-pro-and-m5-max-macbook-pro-what-to-expect.2478235/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

The standout feature here is likely the size. Most modular smartphone concepts start bulky and only get bulkier once attaching accessories. Tecno's base smartphone is just 4.9mm thin, which is significantly thinner than a pencil <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\"><ins>and the iPhone Air</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, the size increases with each attached module. However, snapping on the power bank module makes the thickness comparable to a standard modern smartphone. Another key feature here is how these various modular components stick together. Tecno has developed new interconnection technology that uses both magnets and pin connectors. This should make it easy to both attach and remove components.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The company says this phone has been designed to grow with the user through hardware expansion. To that end, Tecno has developed 10 modules. There are various camera lenses and something that looks like a dedicated gaming controller.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"People holding phones.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/9f4ae160-127e-11f1-b47f-ea3488490078\" style=\"height: 1198px; width: 2128px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Tecno</div></figure>\n<p>While the magnets are for attaching, the pin connectors assist with power delivery. Data transmission between the phone and the modules is handled wirelessly, with the ability to switch between Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mmWave depending on where the user is located.</p>\n<p>There are two colorways for both the phone and the ecosystem of accessories. There's a silver-aluminum edition and a nifty-looking grey version. This doesn't matter to actual consumers because, well, it's just a concept design. It does look like the company's magnetic attachment technology could make it to some actual products down the line.</p>\n<div id=\"d85fd27b5c524d718b50aaf44e728dfe\"></div>\n<p>Tecno has always been a company that marched to the beat of its own drummer. It has developed a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tecno-phantom-v-fold-pricing-availability-mwc-2023-174526995.html\"><ins>surprisingly affordable foldable phone</ins></a>, a model with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tecno-phantom-x2-pro-retractable-portrait-lens-113011384.html\"><ins>pop-out portrait lens</ins></a> and a foldable with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tecnos-phantom-v-flip-phone-puts-a-circular-display-on-its-cover-090836663.html\"><ins>novel circular display on the exterior</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>The industry hasn't quite embraced modular smartphones just yet, even though there have been some nifty concept designs. Google's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-03-project-ara-video-update.html\"><ins>Project Ara prototype</ins></a> goes back more than a decade, and the same can be said of <a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/technology/phonebloks-a-modular-customizable-smartphone/\"><ins>other concept designs</ins></a> that never saw the light of day.</p>\n<p>There have been some modular phones released to the real world, but they weren't nearly as ambitious as Tecno's concept. LG launched a semi-modular phone <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-11-lg-g5-review.html\"><ins>called the G5 back in 2016</ins></a>, but it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/21/13362240/lg-g5-abandoning-modular-phone-android-strategy\"><ins>didn't move too many units</ins></a>. Moto has also released a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-21-moto-z-and-z-force-droid-review.html\"><ins>couple of semi-modular smartphones</ins></a>, but they didn't set the world on fire.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/tecno-just-unveiled-a-ridiculously-thin-modular-smartphone-concept-design-194741776.html?src=rss",

On Wednesday, the company previewed its air taxi booking service ahead of an expected launch in Dubai later this year. The inaugural Uber Air program will let travelers book <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/joby-aviations-first-production-air-taxi-cleared-for-flight-tests-093526681.html\" target=\"_blank\">Joby Aviation's electric air taxis</a> through a familiar process in the Uber app.</p><p>The experience of booking an air taxi will be much like reserving a four-wheeled Uber. In the app, after entering your destination, Uber Air will appear as an option for eligible routes. The Uber app will book a flight and an Uber Black to pick you up and drop you off at a Joby &quot;vertiport.&quot;</p><figure><img alt=\"Three phone screens, showing the process of booking an air taxi in the Uber app\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/uber.jpg\" style=\"height: 1796px; width: 2995px;\" /><figcaption>The process of booking a flying taxi will be instantly familiar.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Uber</div></figure><p>Joby's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/joby-aviation-says-it-completed-a-523-mile-test-flight-of-a-hydrogen-powered-air-taxi-154111466.html\" target=\"_blank\">air taxis</a>, built exclusively for city travel, can accommodate up to four passengers and luggage. (Uber says size and weight guidelines will be announced closer to launch.) The interior is about the size of an SUV and has &quot;comfortable seating&quot; with panoramic windows. They can travel up to 200 mph and have a range of up to 100 miles. Four battery packs and a triple-redundant flight computer are onboard for safety purposes.</p><p>The air taxis aren't (yet) autonomous and will each have a human pilot onboard. That would at least suggest high prices. After all, pilots aren't nearly as cheap as Uber's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/uber-and-lyft-driver-pay-isnt-keeping-up-with-soaring-fares-study-says-173807130.html\" target=\"_blank\">legion of independent-contractor drivers</a>.

We've had helicopters fail at takeoff and landing in airports. They're dangerous not from a fire point of view but in terms of landing on top of people and buildings.&quot; In addition, he warned that air taxis can't be developed in sufficient numbers to make them economically viable &quot;unless they are subsidized by a government.&quot;</p><p>Uber and Joby have partnered since 2019.
