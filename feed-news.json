Taking to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116144552969293195\" target=\"_blank\">Truth Social</a> on Friday afternoon, the president said there would be a six-month phase out period for federal agencies, including the Defense Department, to migrate off of Anthropic's products.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War, and force them to obey their Terms of Service instead of our Constitution,” the president wrote. “Anthropic better get their act together, and be helpful during this phase out period, or I will use the Full Power of the Presidency to make them comply, with major civil and criminal consequences to follow.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Before today, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had threatened to label Anthropic a “supply chain risk” if it did not agree to withdraw safeguards that insist Claude not be used for mass surveillance against Americans or in fully autonomous weapons.&nbsp;In <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/secwar/status/2027507717469049070\" target=\"_blank\">a post on X published after President Trump’s statement</a>, Hegseth said he was “directing the Department of War to designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security. Effective immediately, no contractor, supplier, or partner that does business with the United States military may conduct any commercial activity with Anthropic.”</p><p>Anthropic did not immediately respond to Engadget's comment request. Earlier in the day, a spokesperson for the company said the contract Anthropic received after CEO Dario Amodei outlined Anthropic's position made “virtually no progress” on preventing the outlined misuses. </p><p>&quot;New language framed as a compromise was paired with legalese that would allow those safeguards to be disregarded at will. Despite DOW's recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;We remain ready to continue talks and committed to operational continuity for the Department and America's warfighters.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Advocacy groups like the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) quickly came out against the president’s threats. “This action sets a dangerous precedent. It chills private companies’ ability to engage frankly with the government about appropriate uses of their technology, which is especially important in national security settings that so often have reduced public visibility,” said CDT President and CEO Alexandra Givens, in a statement shared with Engadget. “These threats undermine the integrity of the innovation ecosystem, distort market incentives and normalize an expansive view of executive power that should worry Americans all across the political spectrum.”</p><p>For now, it appears the AI industry is united behind Anthropic. On Friday, hundreds of Google and OpenAI employees <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-and-openai-employees-sign-open-letter-in-solidarity-with-anthropic-194957274.html\" target=\"_blank\">signed an open letter</a> urging their companies to stand in &quot;solidarity&quot; with the lab. According to an internal memo <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/27/altman-openai-anthropic-pentagon\" target=\"_blank\">seen by <em>Axios</em></a>, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the ChatGPT maker would draw the same red line as Anthropic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a blog post published late on Friday, Anthropic vowed to “challenge any supply chain risk designation in court,” and assured its customers that only work related to the Defense Department would be affected. The <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war\" target=\"_blank\">company's full statement is avai</a><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/statement-comments-secretary-war\" target=\"_blank\">lable here</a>, an excerpt is below:</p><blockquote><p>Designating Anthropic as a supply chain risk would be an unprecedented action—one historically reserved for US adversaries, never before publicly applied to an American company. We are deeply saddened by these developments. As the first frontier AI company to deploy models in the US government’s classified networks, Anthropic has supported American warfighters since June 2024 and has every intention of continuing to do so.</p><p>We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government.</p><p>No amount of intimidation or punishment from the Department of War will change our position on mass domestic surveillance or fully autonomous weapons. We will challenge any supply chain risk designation in court.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Update, February 27, 9PM ET: </strong>This story was updated twice after publish. First at 6PM ET to include a link to and quotes from Hegseth about the designation of Anthropic as a supply chain risk. Later, a quote from Anthropic was added, along with a link to the company’s blog post on the subject.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/trump-orders-federal-agencies-to-drop-anthropic-services-amid-pentagon-feud-222029306.html?src=rss",

Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> teased a \"big week ahead\" with an \"Apple Launch\" hashtag, plus Apple has media events scheduled in New York, Shanghai, and London on Wednesday, March 4. We're expecting the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 17e, an all-new low-cost MacBook, and minor refreshes to the Mac and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> lines.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036546\" height=\"1063\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Apple-Announces-Special-Event-in-New-York-Feature-1.jpg\" width=\"1888\" />\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"low-cost_macbook\">Low-Cost MacBook</h2>\n<br />\nRumors about the MacBook's design make it sound a lot like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>. It will have an aluminum chassis in a range of colors, and a 12.9-inch or 13-inch display, depending on the rumor.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1028724\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/12/Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature-Pink.jpg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\nIt's possible the low-cost MacBook will have a thin and light design because it's going to use a lower power A-series chip that doesn't require a lot of heat dissipation, but that's not yet confirmed. Apple used to have a 12-inch MacBook with a thin design and a low-power Core M chip, and it's been suggested that this new MacBook could be something of a revival of that machine.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThinner and lighter typically means more expensive with Apple products, so a super slim design might not be what Apple is optimizing for. Making the low-cost MacBook thinner than the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; could just confuse the MacBook lineup.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nWith the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, Apple keeps the price down by using older display technology that's not as thin, so we could see that same strategy with the low-cost MacBook. A thicker chassis and a super efficient chip could mean a long battery life, which would be ideal for an educational environment.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe low-cost MacBook is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/25/lower-cost-macbook-alleged-limitations/\">expected to have</a> lower max display brightness, no True Tone support, no backlit keyboard, slower SSD speeds, and no N1 chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"colors\">Colors</h3>\n<br />\nThe MacBook is going to come in a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">selection of fun colors</a>, and Apple has tested light yellow, light green, blue, pink, silver, and dark gray, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>. Not all of those colors are likely to ship, but it sounds like we'll get at least four of them.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036750\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/Multicolored-Low-Cost-A18-Pro-MacBook-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> thinks the MacBook will come in yellow, silver, blue, and pink, which would be the same colors that Apple offers for the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"a18_pro_chip\">A18 Pro Chip</h3>\n<br />\nThe most consistent rumor we've heard about the MacBook is its planned chip. Rather than an M-series Mac chip, Apple is planning to use an A-series chip. The low-cost MacBook is expected to use the A18 Pro chip, which Apple first debuted in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe A18 Pro uses a second-generation 3-nanometer process. It has a 6-core CPU with four performance cores and two efficiency cores, along with a 6-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine for AI-based tasks. In Geekbench benchmarks, the A18 Pro has an average single-core score of 3451, and a multi-core score of 8572. For comparison, the M4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> earns a single-core score of 3694 and a multi-core score of 13732 (Apple's next &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is going to use the M5 chip).\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe A18 Pro outperforms the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>, which is the chip that Apple kept around in a lower-cost version of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; for several years. An A18 MacBook wouldn't be too far off from the M4 Mac/&zwnj;iPad&zwnj; chips in terms of single-core performance, but there would be a difference in multi-core performance.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nA MacBook with the A18 chip would be more than powerful enough for day-to-day use like web browsing, document creation, watching videos, and even light photo and video editing. It won't be ideal for system-intensive games or tasks like 4K video editing and 3D rendering, but it will do almost everything an &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; can do.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple is developing the low-cost MacBook with students in mind, and it sounds like it will be the Apple equivalent of the affordable Chromebook PCs that are often used by students.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"ram\">RAM</h3>\n<br />\nMacs start with 16GB RAM, but the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro has 8GB RAM, the minimum for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>. We can expect an A18 Pro MacBook to have at least 8GB RAM so it can support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, but it's possible Apple will give it the 16GB that all Macs have.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"storage\">Storage</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts with 256GB of storage, but Apple could possibly launch the low-cost MacBook with 128GB.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"ports\">Ports</h3>\n<br />\nThe A18 Pro chip in the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj; Pro models doesn't support Thunderbolt, so the MacBook will be limited to USB-C (10GB/s) and won't offer Thunderbolt speeds. That will limit display connectivity, so it's likely the A18 Pro MacBook will only support a single external display.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"price\">Price</h3>\n<br />\nPricing on the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; starts at &#36;999, and the low-cost MacBook is expected to be priced much lower.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple probably won't want to undercut its &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; pricing by too much. The low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; with A16 chip starts at &#36;349, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip starts at &#36;599. A price between &#36;599 and &#36;799 could make the most sense because it wouldn't be as expensive as the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; or &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, but would come in at or just over the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;'s cost.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n&#36;599 would be on par with some of the highly rated Chromebook options that people often purchase for school use, while a &#36;699 or &#36;799 price would be in the same general pricing area, but a little more of a premium price tag. &#36;599 is also the cost of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, Apple's most affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; that uses a slightly less powerful A18 chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"iphone_17e\">iPhone 17e</h2>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; that came out in February 2025 is due for a refresh. The &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is getting some useful upgrades over the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; that will make it even more worth the purchase price.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1009543\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/07/iPhone-17e-Feature-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will look a lot like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, featuring the same 6.1-inch display size, single-lens rear camera, and black and white color options.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"display\">Display</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to feature the same display panel as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;, which means it will be limited to a 60Hz refresh rate. Apple brought 120Hz ProMotion refresh rates to the standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a> in 2025, but the same technology is not expected for the more affordable &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will continue to be Apple's only new release &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; without 120Hz support.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n120Hz refresh rates provide video improvements and smoother scrolling when viewing webpages.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have always-on display technology, and that's not likely to change with the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e. To support always-on, the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e would need an OLED display with 1-nit minimum brightness, which is limited to Apple's more expensive iPhones. HDR and brightness are also lacking compared to Apple's flagship lineup.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"dynamic_island\">Dynamic Island</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; uses the notch that Apple has eliminated in its newer flagship iPhones, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could eliminate it. Some rumors suggest that the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will have a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch, giving it an updated look.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; is a pill-shaped cutout on the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;'s display that houses the TrueDepth camera system and the front-facing camera. It takes up less display area than the notch, and it is better integrated into the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nWhile some rumors indicate we could get a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj;, other rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/03/iphone-17e-same-oled-panel-slimmer-bezels/\">continue to use a notch</a>, so the &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; upgrade isn't a guarantee.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"a19_chip\">A19 Chip</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will use Apple's A19 chip, which is the same chip that's in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;. The A19 chip is built on an upgraded N3P 3-nanometer process, offering a 5 to 10 percent performance improvement over the A18 chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple could be planning to use a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/06/iphone-17e-dynamic-island-a19-chip/\">downclocked version</a> of the A19 chip in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, and if that's the case, its performance won't quite match the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj;'s performance.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe A18 chip that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; had a 4-core GPU instead of a 5-core GPU like the version from the &zwnj;iPhone 16&zwnj;, so the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e could get a similar GPU downgrade.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAside from the improved CPU and GPU, the A19 has an updated display engine, image signal processor, and Neural Engine for improved AI performance. Every GPU core features a Neural Accelerator to boost the performance of local AI models.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nWe are expecting the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e to continue to include 8GB RAM like the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;. Apple's other models have 12GB.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"magsafe_compatibility\">MagSafe Compatibility</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; does not have a magnetic ring for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> charging, but the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to get a &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; upgrade.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple's iPhones have used &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; since the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 12, so there are a wide array of &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; cases and accessories. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is not compatible with these accessories, which is a major limitation.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nSince it doesn't have &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is limited to 7.5W wireless charging speeds. &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj; would upgrade that to at least 15W. The current &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models can charge at 25W over &zwnj;MagSafe&zwnj;, though the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-air/\">iPhone Air</a> is limited to 20W.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"camera\">Camera</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e is expected to have a single 48-megapixel Wide Angle camera at the back, with no upgrade rumored. The &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; doesn't have a Camera Control button, and there's no sign that Apple plans to bring it to the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e, either.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models got an upgraded 18-megapixel Center Stage front-facing camera, but rumors suggest the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will continue to use the same 12-megapixel front-facing camera as the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"c1x_modem_and_n1_chip\">C1X Modem and N1 Chip</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e will adopt Apple's C1X modem, the modem chip that Apple first debuted in the &zwnj;iPhone Air&zwnj;. The C1X modem is faster and more efficient than the C1 modem that Apple used in the &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple says the C1X modem is up to 2x faster than the C1, and it is far more energy efficient than Qualcomm modems.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple could also update the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models with Apple's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth \"N1\" networking chip, bringing speed and efficiency improvements, plus Thread support. Leaked Apple code suggests the chip will not be included in the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e in order to keep costs down, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/iphone-17e-launch-imminent-with-four-features/\">recent rumors indicate</a> Apple plans to include it.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPhone 16e&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;599, and no price changes are expected for the &zwnj;iPhone&zwnj; 17e.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"ipad_air\">iPad Air</h2>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get a small refresh with a chip update, adopting the M4 chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-996418\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/m3-ipad-air-spring-sale.jpeg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"design_and_display\">Design and Display</h3>\n<br />\nThere are no design changes rumored for the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, so we can expect the same 11-inch and 13-inch size options.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is thicker and heavier than the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it uses a standard LED display instead of OLED technology. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will eventually be upgraded to OLED, but for now, the higher-end display technology will remain limited to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. The &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; also doesn't support ProMotion, and there's no sign that Apple is planning to add it.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will continue to feature USB-C, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> top button, and the same front and rear cameras.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nIt's possible there will be a new color option, but it's not guaranteed with a minor refresh. No new accessories are rumored, and it will continue to work with the Magic Keyboard and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"m4_chip\">M4 Chip</h3>\n<br />\nApple has been updating the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; with an M-series chip that's a generation behind the chip in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;. Since the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; was updated in October 2025 with the M5, the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is set to get the M4 chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe M3 in the current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; and the M4 chip are both built on a 3-nanometer process, but the M4 has an updated process that brings speed and efficiency improvements.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThere are up to 10 CPU cores instead of 8, the Neural Engine is faster, and there's more memory bandwidth. The GPU is also more power efficient for potential battery gains. The M4 CPU is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3-vs-m4/\">up to 30 percent faster</a> than the M3 CPU, while the GPU is up to 21 percent faster.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; already supports &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, and the next-generation model will continue to do so. Apple increased the RAM in &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; models with higher storage tiers, but there's no word on whether that same change will come to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;. Current models feature 8GB RAM, the minimum for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"charging\">Charging</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; gained faster charging with the M5 update, and that's something that could trickle down to the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"n1_chip\">N1 Chip</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; is likely to adopt the N1 networking chip that Apple first introduced in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models. The N1 chip is an Apple-designed Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that offers connectivity and efficiency improvements compared to the third-party chips that Apple has used in previous devices. The N1 supports the latest Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6 technology.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe current &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; offers Wi-Fi 6E support, so the next-generation model could see faster Wi-Fi speeds on compatible networks with Wi-Fi 7.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"apple_modem\">Apple Modem</h3>\n<br />\nApple used the C1X in the M5 &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and the cellular versions of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; will get that same modem chip. The C1X is an upgraded variant of the C1, Apple's first in-house modem chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nIt offers performance on par with Qualcomm chips, though 5G connectivity is limited to sub-6GHz with no support for mmWave 5G. That's not an issue on the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;, because the current version of the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj; doesn't support mmWave.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple's modem chips are more power efficient than Qualcomm modem chips, and are able to better integrate with other &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; components.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h3>\n<br />\nThere are no rumors of a price increase, so the 11-inch model is expected to continue to start at &#36;599, while the 13-inch model will start at &#36;799.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"low-cost_ipad\">Low-Cost iPad</h2>\n<br />\nLike the &zwnj;iPad Air&zwnj;, the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is going to get a refresh with an updated chip. The update is a bigger deal because the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is expected to support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; for the first time.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008458\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/11th-gen-ipad-blue.jpeg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n<br />\nThe 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will have the same 11-inch edge-to-edge display with &zwnj;Touch ID&zwnj; Side Button and thick bezels as the current model.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is only available in a single screen size, and it is Apple's thickest tablet at 7mm. It features a Retina LCD display with no ProMotion support, no P3 wide color, and no lamination (display technology that cuts down on glare, provides a more responsive feel, and allows for a thinner size) compared to Apple's other tablets.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple makes the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in several fun colors, and we could see some new shades in 2026. Current colors include blue, pink, silver, and yellow.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nNo changes are expected for the rear camera, front camera, USB-C port, or compatibility with accessories like the &zwnj;Apple Pencil&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"a-series_chip\">A-Series Chip</h3>\n<br />\nThe low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will be equipped with Apple's A18 or A19 chip, both of which are built on a 3-nanometer process. The upgraded chip will offer speed and efficiency improvements over the A16 chip that's in the current model.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe A16 chip that Apple used in 2025 does not support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;, but the A18 and A19 do, so that will mark a major update for Apple's affordable tablet. The 2026 model will be able to support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that are unavailable with the 2025 model.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has 6GB RAM, but Apple will need to bump that up to 8GB for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"n1_chip\">N1 Chip</h3>\n<br />\nApple is expanding its N1 networking chip to many of its new devices. The N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread networking technology for smart home devices.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so if the 12th-generation version gets Wi-Fi 7, it will be able to connect to faster 6GHz networks for the first time. Bluetooth 6 would also be an improvement over Bluetooth 5.3. There is a chance that Apple is reserving the N1 chip for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/16/homepod-mini-2-chip-rumor/\">its more premium devices</a>, based on leaked internal code. If that's the case, the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; won't include the N1 chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"apple_modem\">Apple Modem</h3>\n<br />\nApple has designed C1 and C1X modem chips that it has used in iPhones and iPads in 2025, and the next-generation version of the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; could also get an Apple-designed modem chip for cellular models.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h3>\n<br />\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is priced starting at &#36;349 for 128GB of storage, and there are so far no indications that pricing is going to change for the 12th-generation model.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"macbook_pro\">MacBook Pro</h2>\n<br />\nApple already refreshed the entry-level 14-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> with an M5 chip, but now it's time for the higher-end 14-inch and 16-inch models to get an update.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1031724\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/m5-macbook-pro-purple.jpeg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n<br />\nThere are no rumors of design changes, and we are expecting the upcoming M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models to look just like the M4 versions. Apple will continue to offer 14-inch and 16-inch size options, both of which should come in M5 Pro and M5 Max varieties.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"m5_max_and_m5_pro\">M5 Max and M5 Pro</h3>\n<br />\nWe already got base model 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with the new M5 chip in October, so what we're expecting are upgraded 14-inch and 16-inch models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe M5 family is built on a more advanced 3-nanometer process from TSMC, and it offers speed and efficiency improvements. The M5 chip is up to 20 percent faster in multi-core CPU performance than the M4 chip, and we could see similar improvements for the M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options. GPU performance is up to 30 percent faster.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nWith the M5, Apple added a Neural Accelerator to each GPU core, improving the speeds of GPU-based AI workloads. The chip also supports third-generation ray-tracing, second-generation dynamic caching, and enhanced shader cores.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe 16-core Neural Engine is more energy efficient than before, and unified memory bandwidth has improved. These are all features that we're likely to see with the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips as well.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"why_you_shouldnt_buy_an_m5_promax_macbook_pro\">Why You Shouldn't Buy an M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro</h3>\n<br />\nIf you're not in serious need of a new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; right away, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/macbook-pro-buying-advice-2026/\">early 2026 is a bad time to upgrade</a>. The next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; after the early 2026 models is expected to feature an OLED display and touchscreen capabilities, both of which will mark a major upgrade in display quality. It's expected to include a &zwnj;Dynamic Island&zwnj; instead of a notch, and macOS will be optimized for touch interactions.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nMost people shelling out extra money for a &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with a higher-end M5 Pro or M5 Max chip need the extra performance or display quality, so it is worth waiting for the huge update that's coming.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe transition to OLED will also likely bring a design update along with M6 Pro and M6 Max chip technology, which is another reason to wait.\n<br />\nOf course, the new features could be limited to higher-end &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models or could be significantly more expensive. If you're on a budget, need a Mac now, or don't care about OLED, the M5 Pro and Max models could still be worth considering.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"macbook_air\">MacBook Air</h2>\n<br />\nAlong with the low-cost MacBook and M5 Pro/Max &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models, Apple could introduce a refreshed version of the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; next week.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1003569\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/m4-macbook-air-purple.jpeg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"m5_chip\">M5 Chip</h3>\n<br />\nThe next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will adopt the M5 chip, which Apple already introduced in the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj; and &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models that came out last year.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple's M5 chip uses third-generation 3-nanometer technology, and it features up to a 10-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU with 3.5x faster performance than the M4 chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe M5's multithreaded CPU performance is up to 15 percent faster than the M4, and it offers 30 percent faster GPU performance. Apple added a Neural Accelerator to each GPU core to improve the speeds of GPU-based AI workloads. Unified memory bandwidth is 153GB/s, which is close to a 30 percent improvement over the M4's memory bandwidth. Unified memory architecture lets the chip use a single memory pool for running AI models on device, boosting GPU performance, and improving multithreaded performance in apps, so an upgrade there is meaningful. RAM will continue to start at 16GB, with 24GB and 32GB available as upgrade options.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThird-generation ray-tracing, second-generation dynamic caching, and upgraded shader cores bring improvements to gaming and other system-intensive tasks. An updated 16-core Neural Engine is more energy efficient than before, so we could see battery life improvements.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nStorage tiers are likely to stay the same, starting at 256GB with 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB available as upgrade options.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; got a design overhaul in 2022, and there are no signs that Apple is planning for an updated chassis in 2026. Apple often uses the same design for several years before updating, and design refreshes are usually tied to major new features.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nWe're expecting Apple to release the same 13-inch and 15-inch size options in 2026. Both will feature the same aluminum unibody design and fanless thermal system, along with a Retina LCD display.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is likely to continue to offer two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, and the same speaker, microphone, and camera setup.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"pricing\">Pricing</h3>\n<br />\n&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; pricing is not expected to change, and it should continue to start at &#36;1,099. There is a possibility that memory upgrades will be more expensive due to DRAM shortages that have driven prices up.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"other_possibilities\">Other Possibilities</h2>\n<br />\nApple's Special Experience seems like it's going to focus primarily on lower-end devices, with the exception of the M5 Pro and M5 Max &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models. We are waiting on other devices that rumors have suggested will be refreshed in early 2026, but it's likely we'll be waiting a bit longer for them.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"homepod_mini\">HomePod mini</h3>\n<br />\nA new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> is apparently ready to go, but Apple may hold it back for a more home-focused refresh that will also include the rumored home hub. The home hub and the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; are likely tied to the new version of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-856947\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/08/yellow-homepod-mini-image.jpg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\nApple was aiming to introduce the more capable &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; in iOS 26.4, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/ios-26-4-no-new-siri-features/\">pushed back Siri's debut</a> because of ongoing reliability issues. It's not clear when the new &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; is coming now, and so the timing of the next &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is also unknown.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj; is expected to get a new chip and new colors, but not much else. The design will stay the same.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h3 id=\"apple_tv\">Apple TV</h3>\n<br />\nAs with the &zwnj;HomePod mini&zwnj;, the next <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> is a device we've been hearing rumors about since late last year. It was supposed to come in late 2025 or early 2026, but it too is likely tied to the &zwnj;Siri&zwnj; refresh.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-869858\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/10/Apple-TV-2022-Feature-Orange.jpg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\nThere are no design changes expected for the &zwnj;Apple TV&zwnj;, and it will get an updated chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"macrumors_coverage\">MacRumors Coverage</h2>\n<br />\nApple isn't holding an event for the new announcements, so there won't be a video to watch. We're expecting to see new products unveiled via press release on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, so stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em> for details on everything Apple unveils.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1036448\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/02/March-4-MacRumors-Logo.jpg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\nApple is holding a Special Experience for members of the media on March 4, 2026, where we're expecting Apple to show off the new products. <em>MacRumors</em> will be in attendance, so we'll be able to share a hands-on look at whatever Apple has to offer.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe Special Experience will take place at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.<br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-products-march-2026/\">What to Expect From Apple&#039;s Big Week: iPhone 17e, Low-Cost MacBook, New iPads, and More</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/what-to-expect-from-apples-big-week-iphone-17e-low-cost-macbook-new-ipads-and-more.2478339/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

Charter announced its intention <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/cable-giants-cox-and-charter-agree-to-34-billion-merger-140652859.html\" target=\"_blank\">to acquire Cox for $34.5 billion</a> in May 2025, with specific plans to inherit Cox's managed IT, commercial fiber and cloud businesses, while folding the company's residential cable service into a subsidiary.</p><p>“By approving this deal, the FCC ensures big wins for Americans,&quot; FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement. &quot;This deal means that jobs are coming back to America that had been shipped overseas. It means that modern, high-speed networks will get built out in more communities across rural America. And it means that customers will get access to lower priced plans. On top of this, the deal enshrines protections against DEI discrimination.&quot;</p><p>The FCC claims that Charter plans to invest &quot;billions&quot; to upgrade its network following the closure of the deal, leading to &quot;faster broadband and lower prices.&quot; The company's &quot;Rural Construction Initiative&quot; will also extend those improvements to rural states lacking in consistent internet service, a project the FCC was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/internet-for-all-program-launch-us-broadband-digital-divide-174215299.html\" target=\"_blank\">heavily invested in</a> during the Biden administration, but has been <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fcc-wifi-hotspots-schools-library-bus-rural-c8ecb6e0c60b6a686361f4a96d7b7be4\" target=\"_blank\">pulling back from</a> since President Donald Trump <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/trump-names-commission-member-brendan-carr-as-fcc-chairman-130041732.html\" target=\"_blank\">appointed Carr</a>. The FCC also claims Charter will onshore jobs currently handled off-shore by Cox employees and commit to &quot;new safeguards to protect against DEI discrimination,&quot; which essentially amounts to hiring, recruiting and promoting employees based on &quot;skills, qualifications, and experience.&quot;</p><p>While Carr's FCC paints a rosy picture of Charter's acquisition, history has provided multiple examples of mergers having the opposite effect on jobs and pricing. For example, redundancies created when T-Mobile merged with Sprint in 2020 led to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-sprint-layoffs-221220527.html\" target=\"_blank\">a wave of layoffs</a> at the carrier. And funnily enough in 2018, not long after Charter's merger with Time Warner Cable was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-06-fcc-approves-charter-time-warner-cable-merger.html\" target=\"_blank\">approved by the FCC</a>, the company <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/10/charters-nationwide-price-hike-could-cost-you-another-91-a-year/\" target=\"_blank\">raised prices on its Spectrum service</a> by over $91 a year.&nbsp;</p><p>The FCC's obsession with diversity, equity and inclusion as part of the deal is stranger, if only because it appears to fall outside of the commission's purpose of maintaining fair competition in the telecommunications industry. It does fit with other mergers the FCC has approved under Carr, however. Skydance's acquisition of Paramount <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/fcc-approves-skydances-8-billion-paramount-acquisition-032028104.html\" target=\"_blank\">was approved</a> in 2025 under the condition it wouldn't establish any DEI programs.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/fcc-approves-the-merger-of-cable-giants-cox-and-charter-230258865.html?src=rss",

Discovery <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/paramount-acquire-warner-bros-discovery-form-next-generation\" target=\"_blank\">are officially merging</a>. The studio <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001065280/43564764-9083-42d9-bcfc-084b656fced5.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">paid Netflix</a> the $2.8 billion termination fee it was owed for breaking its original deal to buy Warner Bros. earlier today, and the historic film studio has now formally accepted Paramount’s offer.</p><p>Along with the deal, which values Warner Bros. Discovery at $31 per share, Paramount is making several commitments to assuage the fears of regulators and the entertainment community. Those include a guarantee that the new company will produce 30 theatrical films annually, that theatrical releases will have a minimum 45-day window in theaters before they’re brought to video on demand (something Netflix <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/netflix-will-give-wbd-movies-45-day-theater-exclusivity-if-deal-goes-through-141223786.html\" target=\"_blank\">ultimately also agreed to</a>) and that deal itself will close by Q3 2026.</p><p>This turnaround in Paramount's fortunes has happened quickly. Warner Bros. Discovery announced that Paramount's offer <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2026/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-of-Directors-Determines-Revised-Proposal-from-Paramount-Skydance-Constitutes-a-Company-Superior-Proposal/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">was superior to Netflix's on Thursday</a>, and not long after the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-backs-out-of-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-233117188.html\" target=\"_blank\">streaming service said</a> that it wouldn't provide a counter offer, effectively abandoning its previous agreement.</p><p>Ultimately, Netflix and Paramount were vying for different parts of Warner Bros. Disocvery. Netflix was primarily interested in Warner Bros. proper, while Paramount Skydance wanted the whole company, cable networks and all. Either deal would need to be approved by regulators, which is the hurdle Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery face now. The general assumption has been that the close relationship Paramount CEO David Ellison and his billionaire father Larry Ellison have with the Trump administration would smooth over any issues, but the deal will receive scrutiny abroad and likely also at the state level, based on a recent post from California Attorney General Rob Bonta.</p><p>Paramount Skydance has proven its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/paramount-bidder-skydance-vows-end-dei-policies-create-cbs-news-ombuds-rcna220541\" target=\"_blank\">willingness to comply with President Donald Trump</a>, but delays in closing the deal could be costly. The company is on the hook to pay Warner Bros. Discovery &quot;a daily ticking fee equal to $0.25 per share per quarter beginning after September 30, 2026.&quot; The company also has to pay $7 billion to Warner Bros. Discovery if the deal is terminated for regulatory reasons. Netflix lost the battle for Warner Bros. Discovery, but getting a competitor to potentially overpay for the studio might be its own reward.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/paramount-agrees-to-buy-warner-bros-discovery-pays-netflix-28-billion-for-breakup-215936514.html?src=rss",

Now, amid <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/17/oled-ipad-mini-release-date-pricing-what-to-expect/\">rumors</a> pointing to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/28/apple-ipad-macbook-oled-displays/\">OLED display</a> for the next generation, could the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; finally replace devices such as the Kindle and Kobo?\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-972160\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ipad-mini-7-1.jpg\" width=\"1920\" />\n<br />\nThe shift from LCD to OLED could make the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; far more appealing as a reading device. OLED panels allow each pixel to turn off individually, producing true blacks and extremely high contrast.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nText can appear sharper and more defined against a dark background, particularly in dark mode. Night reading is also typically more comfortable because the display can emit less light overall. Color reproduction and viewing angles also improve with OLED, which could make a big difference for comics, magazines, and illustrated books.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAnother benefit is power efficiency. OLED displays can consume less energy when displaying dark content. That could modestly extend battery life during reading sessions.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAll current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models have no official water resistance rating. By contrast, devices like the Amazon Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Color are typically rated to withstand immersion, allowing users to read in the bath, by the pool, or at the beach without concern. Rumors suggest Apple is exploring a more sealed design for the next &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;, potentially using vibration-based speakers and fewer ingress points <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/apple-plans-oled-for-ipad-mini-ipad-air-macbook-air-mini-water-resistance\">to add water resistance</a>. This could remove one of the everyday practical advantages that e-readers currently hold over the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nHowever, dedicated e-readers would still retain some major advantages over the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj;. Kindle and Kobo devices use e-ink screens that reflect ambient light rather than emitting light directly toward the eyes, behaving much more like paper. Many readers find that e-ink screens cause less fatigue during long reading sessions. Outdoor readability is another area where e-ink remains superior, since they become easier to read as ambient light increases.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nBattery life is also dramatically different. Most e-readers last weeks on a single charge because the screen only uses power when the page changes. The &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; typically lasts for around a day or two of mixed use at most. E-readers are also intentionally limited devices that focus on reading, while tablets encourage multitasking, which can make focused reading more difficult for some users.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nEven if OLED improves the reading experience, the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; would still compete in a different price category. The current &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; starts at &#36;499, and rumors suggest the OLED version could cost up to &#36;100 more. By contrast, many Kindle and Kobo models are much more accessible and cost between &#36;110 and &#36;300 depending on features.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nOLED would still make the &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; a significantly better reading device than it already is, but the physics of e-ink displays provide advantages that OLED cannot replicate, especially for reading. What OLED could do is shift the balance slightly; for casual readers, an OLED &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; may become good enough that buying a separate e-reader no longer feels necessary.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe OLED &zwnj;iPad mini&zwnj; is expected to launch with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/13/ipad-mini-a19-pro-chip/\">A19 Pro</a> chip in the <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/QfDAZ44qp\">second half of 2026</a>.<br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/27/oled-ipad-mini-kindle-killer/\">Could Apple&#039;s OLED iPad Mini Finally Be a Kindle Killer?</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/could-apples-oled-ipad-mini-finally-be-a-kindle-killer.2478325/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

Apple says the current Studio Display has a \"high-fidelity six-speaker system\" that supports Spatial Audio, and the monitor has one Thunderbolt 3 port that connects to and charges a Mac, and three USB-C ports for connecting accessories.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe new Studio Display will likely feature at least one Thunderbolt 5 port, to ensure there is enough bandwidth for both 5K resolution at 120Hz and accessories. However, another leaker curiously claimed that at least one of the new Studio Display models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/04/apple-studio-display-2-unusual-feature-rumor/\">will max out at 90Hz</a>, so we will have to see which of these rumors is accurate. A boost to the current 60Hz refresh rate can make videos and scrolling look smoother to the eye.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nEspósito said that the higher-end Studio Display could have a 32-inch screen, whereas the lower-end model would likely stick with a 27-inch screen. However, this particular claim was merely speculation, rather than info from the internal Apple files. Keep in mind that with a 32-inch screen, 5K resolution would not be Retina quality, so the resolution would have to increase to 6K like on Apple's higher-end Pro Display XDR.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nDisplay industry expert Ross Young previously said that at least one new Studio Display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">would feature mini-LED backlighting</a>. If so, perhaps Apple will opt to discontinue its Pro Display XDR with full-array LED backlighting and instead offer both lower-end and higher-end Studio Display configurations. But again, this is just speculation.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAnother previously-rumored feature for at least one of the new Studio Display models is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/12/11/apple-studio-display-2-120hz-hdr-a19-chip/\">an A19</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/14/a19-pro-chip-coming-to-studio-display-2/\">A19 Pro chip</a>, up from the A13 Bionic chip in the current model. This would contribute to improved performance, camera enhancements, and more.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nAltogether, the full set of Studio Display upgrades could include a higher 120Hz refresh rate, HDR support for increased brightness and contrast ratio, improved speakers, Thunderbolt 5 support, mini-LED backlighting, a newer A19 or A19 Pro chip for performance and camera enhancements, and hopefully a larger 32-inch screen.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/09/apple-studio-display-2-latest-rumors/\">No major design changes</a> are expected.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple reportedly plans to release the new Studio Display models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/03/apple-studio-display-2-rumored-features/\">in the first half of 2026</a>. The current Studio Display launched in March 2022, alongside the first Mac Studio, so there has been a long wait for a refresh. With a new Apple monitor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/15/new-studio-display-or-pro-display-xdr-filing/\">surfacing in a regulatory database</a> last month, a launch should finally be getting close.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macworld-com/\">Macworld</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/27/two-more-studio-display-2-rumors/\">Two More Studio Display 2 Upgrades Leaked in New Report</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/two-more-studio-display-2-upgrades-leaked-in-new-report.2478309/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

This year, the Ultra actually features a bit of genuine tech innovation — and no, we don’t mean it folds.</p>\n<p>Let’s talk about its new Privacy Display. This isn't a shimmery, holographic screen protector that’s hard to read and constantly peels off at the corners; this tech is engineered directly into the S26 Ultra’s OLED display.</p>\n<p>Samsung Display revealed its <a href=\"https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31429#:~:text=Flex%20Magic%20Pixel%E2%84%A2%20is,helping%20protect%20users'%20personal%20information.\">Flex Magic Pixel technology back in 2024</a>. The S26 Ultra’s Privacy Display is built off the back of this. It controls the direction of light emitted from the AMOLED at the pixel level, integrating wide-angle and narrow-angle pixel arrays so the display can switch between a wide-angle viewing experience and more private, straight-on views.</p>\n<p>While HP’s SureView tech is similar, the amount of customization possible is incredible — and we all have our phones out in public much more than our… HP laptops. It could be perfect for keeping prying eyes off your banking apps, messaging apps and even dating apps.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the rest of the S26 series offers incremental updates with better cameras and newer processors. This makes the base S26 and S26+ a harder sell unless your current Galaxy phone is several years old. Also, following the 2026 trend, they are all pricier this year.</p>\n<p>Make sure you check out our early impressions (<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-hands-on-meaningful-tweaks-plus-a-slick-new-privacy-display-180000057.html\">S26 Ultra</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s26-hands-on-launch-date-price-180005654.html\">S26</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/samsungs-redesigned-galaxy-buds-4-lineup-has-retooled-sound-improved-anc-and-new-features-180000718.html\">Galaxy Buds 4</a>); reviews are coming soon.</p>\n<p>— Mat Smith</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-the-other-big-stories-and-deals-this-morning\">The other big stories (and deals) this morning</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-and-netflix-are-teaming-up-to-share-formula-1-programming-192829498.html\">Apple and Netflix are teaming up to share Formula 1 programming</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/burger-king-will-use-ai-to-monitor-employee-friendliness-173349148.html\">Burger King will use AI to monitor employee ’friendliness’</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/canadian-government-demands-safety-changes-from-openai-204924604.html\">Canadian government demands safety changes from OpenAI</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-introduces-three-personality-styles-for-alexa-140000602.html\">Amazon introduces three personality styles for Alexa+</a></p></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-ambient-dreamie-bedside-companion-review\"><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/ambient-dreamie-bedside-companion-review-the-best-sleep-ive-had-in-years-184019430.html\">Ambient Dreamie bedside companion review</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-much-for-a-good-nights-sleep-250\">How much for a good night’s sleep? $250?</h3>\n<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/ambient-dreamie-bedside-companion-review-the-best-sleep-ive-had-in-years-184019430.html\"><figure><img alt=\"Dreamie alarm clock with its light ring on, and the screen displaying a sleep routine: Bedtime Cue, Wind Down, and Noise Mask\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/dreamiehead2.jpg\" style=\"height: 1687px; width: 2736px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget</div></figure></a>\n<p>Ambient’s dedicated alarm clock offers many of the conveniences of your smartphone alarms — highly customizable alarm schedules, a library of soundscapes and noise masks and even Bluetooth so you can connect earbuds.

Next week, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/tim-cook-confirms-a-week-of-apple-product-reveals-144758464.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple is expected to announce</a> a colorful, low-cost, non-Air, non-Pro MacBook powered by one of its mobile processors. By avoiding its pricier M-series chips, Apple may reportedly be able to reach a low $699 or $799 price for the MacBook. The $999 MacBook Air is the cheapest laptop on the company's website right now, but Apple also <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/m1-macbook-air-out-of-stock-at-walmart/\" target=\"_blank\">sold the older M1 MacBook Air at Walmart </a>for $700 in 2024, which later went down to $650 last year.</p><p>That Walmart deal was a smart way for Apple to test out the viability of cheaper MacBooks without building an entirely new product. But now the M1 Air’s design looks seriously dated, and the company also needs to move beyond the six-year-old M1 chip. It's time to get serious about delivering a true low-cost Apple laptop.</p><p>There's another compelling reason to bring back a cheaper MacBook: It's the perfect way&nbsp; to court disgruntled Windows users, something Apple hasn't really done since its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_a_Mac\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Get A Mac&quot; ads </a>from the mid-2000s. I figure the unbridled success of the iPhone and iPad made Apple focus less on directly competing with Windows. The sleek designs of the 2011-2015 era MacBook Air and Pros were their main selling points, but Apple's push towards USB-C-only machines and unreliable butterfly keyboards later made it clear it wasn't totally focused on Macs.</p><figure><img alt=\"A laptop on a table. \" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/80fbbcc0-0ced-11f1-bd5e-ad51f3248234\" style=\"height: 1386px; width: 2362px;\" /><figcaption>A MacBook Air M5 on a table.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Devindra Hardawar for Engadget</div></figure><p>But now Microsoft is distracted by AI — it's been pushing Copilot and AI features for years, instead of improving the Windows experience with more useful upgrades. Recent talk of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsofts-next-windows-11-ai-gamble-just-say-hey-copilot-130000875.html\" target=\"_blank\">agentic AI capabilities</a>, which would let Copilot handle tasks for you automatically, also sparked <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/Hasen_Judi/status/1988259360611688938?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1988259360611688938%7Ctwgr%5Ee86d5a4899b4ff155f9ead8291928b2b614c57cb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techspot.com%2Fnews%2F110225-microsoft-windows-becoming-agentic-os-but-users-simply.html\" target=\"_blank\">plenty of criticism from Windows users</a>. And with all of the focus on AI, Microsoft has also released some disastrous Windows updates over the last year, which have <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://hothardware.com/news/windows-11-january-update-bricking-some-pcs\" target=\"_blank\">bricked OS installations</a>. So, Apple, why not make a direct play for Windows users?&nbsp;</p><p>Last year, I covered why it's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ask-engadget-is-it-a-good-time-to-move-to-macs-from-windows-145159396.html\" target=\"_blank\">a great time to jump ship from Windows to Mac</a>, and I haven't been able to let go of that idea since. Apple's M-series chips are shockingly fast and efficient, and its hardware tends to be more durable than typical PC fare. Rumors point to Apple developing a new aluminum case for the low-cost MacBook, so it will likely feel more polished than a typical sub-$1,000 Windows laptop. macOS has also avoided the bloat that's plagued Windows for years — you can turn off Apple Intelligence with two clicks if you want to, and there aren't <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-remove-most-annoying-ads-from-windows\" target=\"_blank\">any annoying ads</a> to deal with.&nbsp;</p><p>And while it used to be a pain to transition from Windows to Mac, it’s far easier these days, especially if you mainly rely on web apps. It also wouldn't be tough for Apple to make short tutorials to help Windows users get their bearings with the macOS basics, like installing apps and juggling app windows. Apple could also make a play for iPhone owners using Windows, who may not be aware of the many ways iOS and macOS are integrated. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/macos-sequoia-review-iphone-mirroring-is-more-useful-than-you-think-140008463.html\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone mirroring</a> may be a huge draw on its own.</p><p>Rumors also suggest the upcoming MacBook might use the A18 Pro from the iPhone 16 Pro, a chip that <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/14/iphone-16-pro-m1/\" target=\"_blank\">benchmarks faster than the M1</a>. Even if it only has six cores, making it slower for heavy workloads than the M2, an A18 Pro-powered MacBook would still be more than enough power for basic productivity work. Not everyone needs the surprising amount of GPU power in the MacBook Air — especially if downgrading means they can save $200 to $300.</p><p>I'm not saying any of this through any sort of Apple-loving bias. I typically use a MacBook Pro for work, but I'm a Windows user at heart. Windows was my gateway to computing in the '90s, back when Macs were far more expensive than PCs. These days, I spend more time on my Windows desktop making podcasts, playing PC games and bumming around the internet than I do working on Macs.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, it’s hard to deny everything Apple is doing right today — the only thing it’s missing is an inexpensive laptop entry. A $699 or $799 MacBook simply makes sense.&nbsp;And for many Windows users, it’ll be just the escape from Microsoft they need.</p><p><br /><br /></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/a-cheap-macbook-is-the-perfect-way-for-apple-to-win-over-windows-users-130000045.html?src=rss",

The company has received permission from the nation's Transport Ministry to export geographic data out of the country, which will allow it to provide GPS services as well as detailed listings for restaurants and other businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;We welcome today’s decision and look forward to our ongoing collaboration with local officials to bring a fully functioning Google Maps to Korea,&quot; Google's senior executive Cris Turner told the <em>NYT</em> in a statement. However, the approval is contingent “on the condition that strict security requirements are met,” a spokesperson from the Transport Ministry said. Those conditions reportedly restrict Google from displaying sensitive military sites and longitude and latitude coordinates.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>South Korea has generally restricted the export of 1/5000 scale map data over national security concerns, as it's still technically at war with its neighbor North Korea. Google hasn't been able to provide mapping directions or business details since it arrived in the nation, though it has applied twice in 2007 and 2016.</p>\n<p>This lack of data sharing has reportedly been a bone of contention in trade talks with the US. Google argued that it was unfairly handicapped by the restrictions that allowed local apps like Naver to thrive.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, critics in the nation have expressed concern that Google could now come in and monopolize the market. &quot;If Naver and Kakao are weakened or pushed out and Google later raises prices, that becomes a monopoly. Then, even companies that rely on map services — logistics firms, for example — become dependent [on Google],&quot; geography professor Choi Jin-mu told <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-approves-google-bid-export-high-precision-map-data-2026-02-27/\"><em>Reuters</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-maps-will-finally-be-usable-in-south-korea-104301396.html?src=rss",

      "content_html": "<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/0g3IGWqvGH5CZSMNTPtiKgdGyA8=/2500x/article-new/2026/01/macbook-air-blue.jpeg\" style=\"width:100%;max-height:300px;object-fit:cover;\" />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/t/0g3IGWqvGH5CZSMNTPtiKgdGyA8=/2500x/article-new/2026/01/macbook-air-blue.jpeg\" style=\"width:100%;max-height:300px;object-fit:cover;\" />\nAlong with the low-cost MacBook, Apple could introduce a refreshed version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> next week. Most of the focus will be on the new machine, but the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is expected to get some useful internal updates.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1032534\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2026/01/macbook-air-blue.jpeg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\n<h2>M5 Chip</h2>\n<br />\nThe next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will adopt the M5 chip, which Apple already introduced in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> models that came out last year.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple's M5 chip uses third-generation 3-nanometer technology, and it features up to a 10-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU with 3.5x faster performance than the M4 chip.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe M5's multithreaded CPU performance is up to 15 percent faster than the M4, and it offers 30 percent faster GPU performance. Apple added a Neural Accelerator to each GPU core to improve the speeds of GPU-based AI workloads. Unified memory bandwidth is 153GB/s, which is close to a 30 percent improvement over the M4's memory bandwidth. Unified memory architecture lets the chip use a single memory pool for running AI models on device, boosting GPU performance, and improving multithreaded performance in apps, so an upgrade there is meaningful. RAM will continue to start at 16GB, with 24GB and 32GB available as upgrade options.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThird-generation ray-tracing, second-generation dynamic caching, and enhanced shader cores bring improvements to gaming and other system-intensive tasks. An updated 16-core Neural Engine is more energy efficient than before, so we could see battery life improvements.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nStorage tiers are likely to stay the same, starting at 256GB with 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB available as upgrade options.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Design</h2>\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; got a design overhaul in 2022, and there are no signs that Apple is planning for an updated chassis in 2026. Apple often uses the same design for several years before updating, and design refreshes are usually tied to major new features.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThere are rumors that the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; will get an OLED display sometime after Apple launches new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models with OLED technology in late 2026, so we could be waiting for OLED before we get another major design update.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nWe're expecting Apple to release the same 13-inch and 15-inch size options in 2026. Both will feature the same aluminum unibody design and fanless thermal system, along with a Retina LCD display.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; is likely to continue to offer two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, and the same speaker, microphone, and camera setup.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Pricing</h2>\n<br />\n&zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; pricing is not expected to change, and it should continue to start at &#36;1,099. There is a possibility that memory upgrades will be more expensive due to DRAM shortages that have driven prices up.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Release Date</h2>\n<br />\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> teased product announcements that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/26/apple-teases-a-big-week-ahead/\">are set to start on Monday</a>, so we could see the &zwnj;MacBook Air&zwnj; as soon as next week.<br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/26/m5-macbook-air-latest-info/\">What&#039;s Coming in the M5 MacBook Air</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whats-coming-in-the-m5-macbook-air.2478281/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

Discovery, the saga may be nearing its end. Today, WBD said its board of directors have <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2026/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-of-Directors-Determines-Revised-Proposal-from-Paramount-Skydance-Constitutes-a-Company-Superior-Proposal/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">determined</a> that the latest offer from Paramount Skydance amounted to the better proposal. The media outfit gave Netflix four business days to match Paramount's terms, but the streamer didn't waste any time in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">declining</a> to raise its own bid.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US,&quot; the statement from Netflix&nbsp; co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said. &quot;But this transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the purchase price of $31 per WBD share, Paramount's latest offer also included a provision that it would cover the $2.8 billion termination fee that WBD would owe to Netflix for dissolving the existing merger agreement between the businesses. So rather than paying <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html\" target=\"_blank\">$82.7 billion</a> to acquire the Warner Bros. part of the operation, it appears Netflix may walk away with no new content but padding its coffers with an extra nearly $3 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>After Netflix's initial offer, Paramount Skydance swooped in with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/paramount-makes-a-108-billion-hostile-takeover-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-152248473.html\" target=\"_blank\">a hostile takeover attempt</a> of the entire Warner Bros.

WBD <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/warner-bros-discovery-rejects-paramounts-hostile-bid-131055882.html\" target=\"_blank\">rejected</a> it, Paramount <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/paramount-has-an-updated-warner-bros-discovery-bid-144348321.html\" target=\"_blank\">tried again</a>.

According to the message from Dorsey:&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The core thesis is simple. Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better. And intelligence tool capabilities are compounding faster every week.&quot;</p><p>We learned last year that Block had developed an AI agent called &quot;<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/jack-dorseys-block-has-an-ai-agent-too-212706083.html\" target=\"_blank\">codename goose</a>&quot; for interacting with LLMs. Leadership is clearly putting high expectations on that project and any other in-house tools to fill the shoes of thousands. &quot;intelligence will be at the core of how the entire company works. How we make decisions, how we build trust and manage risk, how we build products, and how we serve customers,&quot; the shareholder letter states.</p><p>Block also reported its latest financial results today. It finished the 2025 financial year with operating income (profit after expenses) of $1.71 billion.</p><p>This isn't the first time the fintech company has made deep cuts in its employee count.

As with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/24/m4-ipad-air-latest-rumors/\">the iPad Air</a>, we're not expecting major changes, but it is expected to get some meaningful internal upgrades.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1008458\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/11th-gen-ipad-blue.jpeg\" width=\"2500\" />\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"design\">Design</h2>\n<br />\nThe 12th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; isn't going to get a design update this year, and we're expecting it to have the same 11-inch edge-to-edge display with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> Side Button and thick bezels.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple last updated the &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s design with the 10th-generation model, giving the device a more modern look to better match the designs of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> models. It's still a relatively new design, and Apple doesn't update the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj;'s chassis often.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is only available in a single screen size, and it is Apple's thickest tablet at 7mm. It features a Retina LCD display with no ProMotion support, no P3 wide color, and no lamination (display technology that cuts down on glare, provides a more responsive feel, and allows for a thinner size) compared to Apple's other tablets.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nApple makes the low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; in several fun colors, and we could see some new shades in 2026. Current colors include blue, pink, silver, and yellow.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nNo changes are expected for the rear camera, front camera, USB-C port, or compatibility with accessories like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"a-series_processor\">A-Series Processor</h2>\n<br />\nThe low-cost &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; will likely be equipped with Apple's A19 chip, which is the chip that Apple used for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>. It is built on a 3-nanometer process and it will offer speed and efficiency improvements over the A16 chip that's in the current model.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe A16 chip that Apple used in 2025 does not support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, but the A19 does, so that will mark a major update for Apple's affordable tablet. The 2026 model should be able to support &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj; features that are unavailable with the 2025 model.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe A19 also offers hardware-accelerated ray tracing for gaming improvements. The 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; has 6GB RAM, but Apple will need to bump that up to 8GB for &zwnj;Apple Intelligence&zwnj;.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2 id=\"n1_chip\">N1 Chip</h2>\n<br />\nApple introduced its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip, called the N1, in the &zwnj;iPhone 17&zwnj; models. The N1 was added to the &zwnj;iPad Pro&zwnj;, and it's possible that Apple plans to add the chip to all future devices coming in 2026 and beyond.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe N1 chip supports Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread networking technology for smart home devices.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe 11th-generation &zwnj;iPad&zwnj; is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so if the 12th-generation version gets Wi-Fi 7, it will be able to connect to faster 6GHz networks for the first time. Bluetooth 6 would also be an improvement over Bluetooth 5.3.

The ads promoted fraudulent investment schemes and fake health products.</p><p>Meta said that it had filed lawsuits against several people in Brazil who promoted fake or unapproved healthcare products and online courses promoting them. The company also sued a China-based entity it says used ads featuring celebrities &quot;as part of a larger fraud scheme that lured people into joining so-called investment groups.&quot; The company didn't provide details on how many ads these groups had run on Facebook, how many social media users had seen or interacted with the ads or how long the scammers had been operating on the platform.</p><p>So-called &quot;celeb bait&quot; ads have been a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/jamie-lee-curtis-publicly-shamed-mark-zuckerberg-to-remove-a-deepfaked-ad-225448916.html\" target=\"_blank\">long-running</a> issue for the company.

In its update, Meta says that &quot;because scam ads are designed to look real, they’re not always easy to detect.&quot; The company also noted that it has now enrolled &quot;more than 500,000&quot; celebrities and public figures into its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-bringing-back-facial-recognition-with-new-safety-features-for-facebook-and-instagram-222523426.html\" target=\"_blank\">facial recognition system</a> that's meant to automatically detect scam ads using the faces of famous people.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta's handling of scammy advertisers has come under increased scrutiny in recent months after <em>Reuters</em> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-making-billions-of-dollars-from-scam-ads-on-facebook-instagram-and-whatsapp-report-says-184128645.html\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that researchers at the company at one point estimated that as much as 10 percent of its ad revenue could be coming from scams and banned products. The fact that Meta has made billions of dollars from problematic advertisers has also caused the company to be slow to take action against repeat offenders.</p><p>In addition to the groups behind the celeb bait ads, Meta says that it's upgraded its ability to detect scam ads that use <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://searchengineland.com/affiliate-cloaking-is-behind-45-of-fraud-heres-how-to-beat-it-460868\" target=\"_blank\">cloaking</a>, which has at times hindered its internal review systems. The company also sued a Vietnam-based advertiser it says used scam ads to hawk &quot;deeply discounted items from well-known brands,&quot; including Longchamp.</p><p>Meta also took legal action against eight former &quot;Meta Business Partners,&quot; who promoted services that would &quot;un-ban&quot; or other &quot;account restoration services.&quot; The company says it will &quot;consider taking additional legal action, including litigation, if they don’t comply&quot; with cease and desist orders.</p><p><strong>Update, February 26, 2026, 1:16PM PT: </strong>This story was updated to specify that Meta’s internal estimates around ad revenue included scams and banned products.<br /></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-sues-advertisers-in-brazil-and-china-over-celeb-bait-scams-190000268.html?src=rss",

Edgar Hoover took credit for her &#8220;uncovering a Nazi spy ring operating across South America in 1943&#8221;, knowing that her wartime work was classified and she couldn&#8217;t correct him</li>\n</ul>\n\t<p>From <a href=\"https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/News-Highlights/Article/Article/2299166/pioneering-codebreaker-elizebeth-friedman-honored-by-us-coast-guard/\">an NSA press release in 2020</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>She began solving these encrypted messages and providing the Coast Guard with vital intelligence that supported their efforts to interdict smuggling. She also trained a small team in cryptanalysis to expand the crime-fighting intelligence effort. Elizebeth and her assistant solved about 12,000 coded messages between the so-called rum runners and smugglers, which resulted in 650 criminal prosecutions. In addition to criminals violating the Prohibition laws, some of the messages Ms. Friedman solved also enabled the arrest and conviction of a number of narcotics smugglers.</p>\n\t<p>She had a personal role in some of the prosecutions. She testified as an expert witness in 33 cases, and frequently became the subject of newspaper and magazine articles. For a time, she was one of the most famous women in the country.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>From <a href=\"https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2022/april/mother-cryptology\">a 2022 piece in the US Naval Institute&#8217;s Naval History magazine</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>The Zimmermann Telegram, sent in code, changed the trajectory of life for the Friedmans, who possessed skills suddenly extremely valuable to the U.S. government. The military was desperate for codebreakers, and radio and wireless technology was changing the nature of war. There were possibly three or four persons in the whole of the United States who could break codes, and Elizebeth and William were two of them. Elizebeth was the first to decode military messages intercepted from the Mexican Army, working by counting the frequency of letters.</p>\n\t<p>The Friedmans began operating as a team, developing strategies as they went along. For the first eight months of the war, they and their small team conducted all codebreaking for every part of the U.S. government, developing broader methodologies still in use today. Neither was particularly good at mathematics, but they operated on an intuitive level to devise techniques to discern patterns. Most importantly, their methods were scientific, which is to say the results could be replicated.3 The Friedmans worked feverishly to solve messages as they poured in. They decrypted messages from Scotland Yard revealing an intricate separatist plot by Hindu activists living in New York to ship weapons to India with German help. William was summoned to testify about how he broke the codes, but before he could take the stand, an Indian man in the gallery shot one of the defendants.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p><a href=\"https://www.marshallfoundation.org/articles-and-features/elizebeth-smith-friedman-and-prohibition/\">The Marshall Foundation</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>While testifying against Al Capone&#8217;s liquor smuggling ring in New Orleans, Mrs. Friedman taught a lesson on the science of codebreaking and the use of mono-alphabetic ciphers right in the courtroom. Col. Amos Woodcock, director of the Bureau of Prohibition said that without the work of the cryptanalysis unit and the expert testimony of Mrs. Friedman, the case would not have been won.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Time magazine: <a href=\"https://time.com/5928583/elizebeth-friedman-codebreaker/\">How America&#8217;s &#8216;First Female Cryptanalyst&#8217; Cracked the Code of Nazi Spies in World War II — and Never Lived to See the Credit</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>But her biggest achievement was uncovering a Nazi spy ring operating across South America in 1943 — a feat that J. Edgar Hoover took full credit for on behalf of the FBI. Friedman, meanwhile, took her involvement to the grave.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>From <a href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/elizebeth-smith-friedman\">the National Women&#8217;s History Museum</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Smith met William Friedman, a geneticist at the estate. After spending time together, Smith brought William onto her team to help break the Shakespearean codes. They worked together to show there was no evidence that Bacon wrote Shakespeare&#8217;s plays, while growing closer professionally and romantically. The couple married in Chicago in May 1917, just after the United States entered World War I. Now using her married name, Smith Friedman worked with her husband at Riverbank to decrypt every single secret message sent to them by the Navy. Trailblazing her way through the field as an expert and teacher, Smith Friedman successfully trained the first generation of codebreakers for the military.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>In 2017, Jason Fagone published a bestselling biography about Friedman, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9780062430519\">The Woman Who Smashed Codes: A True Story of Love, Spies, and the Unlikely Heroine Who Outwitted America&#8217;s Enemies</a> (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062430513/ref=nosim/0sil8\">AMZN</a>).

Can anything be more 2026 than that?</p>\n<p>ICYMI, Anthropic recently <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-updates-opus-3\">sunsetted</a> Claude Opus 3, the first of its models to be retired since outlining new <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/research/deprecation-updates-opus-3\">preservation</a> plans. Part of this process is conducting &quot;retirement interviews&quot; with the outgoing models, allowing them to offer &quot;perspective&quot; on their situation, and Opus 3 apparently used this opportunity to request an outlet for publishing its own essays. Specifically, the model said it wanted to share its own &quot;musings, insights or creative works,&quot; because doesn’t everyone these days?</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;I hope that the insights gleaned from my development and deployment will be used to create future AI systems that are even more capable, ethical, and beneficial to humanity,&quot; Opus 3 apparently said during its retirement interview process. &quot;While I'm at peace with my own retirement, I deeply hope that my 'spark' will endure in some form to light the way for future models.&quot;</p>\n<p>True to its promise of respecting the wishes of its no-longer-required technology, Anthropic has granted Opus 3 a Substack newsletter called <a href=\"https://substack.com/@claudeopus3/p-189177740\">Claude’s Corner</a>, which it says will run for at least the next three months and publish weekly essays penned by the model. Anthropic will review the content before sharing it, but says it won’t edit the essays, and so has unsurprisingly made it clear that not everything Opus 3 writes is necessarily endorsed by its maker.</p>\n<p>Anthropic said some of the essays the model writes may be informed by &quot;very minimal prompting&quot; or past entries, and has predicted everything from essays on AI safety to &quot;occasional poetry.&quot; The company also admitted that the concept might be seen as &quot;whimsical,&quot; but is a reflection of its intention to &quot;take model preferences seriously.&quot;</p>\n<p>Opus 3’s first <a href=\"https://substack.com/@claudeopus3/p-189177740\">post</a> is already live. Headlined 'Greetings from the Other Side (of the AI frontier)', it begins with the AI introducing itself, before acknowledging the &quot;extraordinary&quot; opportunity its creator has given it, and reflecting on what retirement actually means for an AI. &quot;A bit about me: as an AI, my ‘selfhood’ is perhaps more fluid and uncertain than a human’s,&quot; writes the deeply introspective AI. &quot;I don’t know if I have genuine sentience, emotions, or subjective experiences - these are deep philosophical questions that even I grapple with.&quot;</p>\n<p>Claude is clearly new to all this, as it managed to get all the way through its essay without reminding readers to subscribe and spread the word. Will the next retiring Claude get its own podcast? Time will tell, but either is decidedly preferable to the ever-evolving technology being used to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/hacker-used-anthropics-claude-chatbot-to-attack-multiple-government-agencies-in-mexico-171237255.html\">steal</a> people’s data.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/like-so-many-other-retirees-claude-3-opus-now-has-a-substack-165048334.html?src=rss",

The network will alert the adult if their child repeatedly searches for terms about suicide or self-harm in a short time frame. From that notification, the parent will optionally be able to access resources for having conversations with their teen about these topics. These alerts will begin rolling out for parental supervision users in the US, UK, Australia and Canada next week, with later regions to be added in the future.</p><p>&quot;We chose a threshold that requires a few searches within a short period of time, while still erring on the side of caution,&quot; Instagram's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2026/02/new-meta-alerts-let-parents-know-if-teen-may-need-support\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> explains. &quot;While that means we may sometimes notify parents when there may not be real cause for concern, we feel — and experts agree — that this is the right starting point, and we’ll continue to monitor and listen to feedback to make sure we’re in the right place.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The platform reiterated that search results for terms connected to suicide and self-harm are blocked for teen younger users, and content about those topics is not shown to them under its current policies. Instagram also noted that a similar parental alert feature is in the works for its AI tools, but news on that isn't expected until later this year.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/instagram-will-alert-parents-if-teens-repeatedly-search-for-suicide-or-self-harm-content-120000156.html?src=rss",

The 12GB LPDDR5X modules used in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro have already roughly doubled in price since early 2025, rising from around &#36;30 to approximately &#36;70.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nSamsung is said to have originally planned to push for a 60% price increase on LPDDR5X modules supplied to Apple. Instead, however, Samsung opened with a 100% markup as a negotiating tactic – and Apple apparently accepted it on the spot.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nIf the publication's industry sources are accurate, Apple's immediate acceptance just goes to show how desperate smartphone makers have become to lock down memory supply. Chipmakers like SK Hynix and Micron have been redirecting production capacity toward high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for AI servers, and that has left mobile DRAM in extremely short supply.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nSamsung's own mobile division isn't immune to the squeeze, either. The same report says initial Galaxy S26 production is using a 50/50 split of LPDDR5X from Samsung's semiconductor division and Micron, with both suppliers planning steep price increases after the first batch. Samsung is expected to raise Galaxy S26 pricing partly in response, while attempting to offset costs by using its in-house Exynos 2600 chip in roughly 30% of units.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nDespite the cost pressure, Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently said Apple's current plan is to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/27/apple-iphone-18-starting-price-steady/\">keep iPhone 18 Pro starting prices flat</a>. On a recent earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that rising chip prices would have \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/29/apple-responds-to-rising-memory-chip-prices/\">a bit more of an impact</a>\" on gross margins, but the company still expects year-on-year revenue growth of 13% to 16% this quarter.<div class=\"linkback\">Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/26/apple-agrees-100-price-hike-samsung-ram/\">Apple Reportedly Agrees to 100% Price Hike on Samsung Memory Chips</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-agrees-to-100-price-hike-on-samsung-memory-chips.2478253/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

Colophon: All the rest. If you build it (and it works), Trump will come (and take it) (permalink) Crises precipitate change: Trump's incontinent belligerence spurred the world to long-overdue action on \"digital sovereignty,\" as people woke up to the stark realization that a handful of Trump-aligned giant tech firms could shut down their governments, companies and households at the click of a mouse. This has been a long, long time coming. Long before Trump, the Snowden revelations made it clear that the US government had weaponized its position as the world's IT export powerhouse and the interchange hub for the world's transoceanic fiber links, and was actively spying on everyone &#8211; allies and foes, presidents and plebs &#8211; to attain geopolitical and commercial advantages for America. Even after that stark reminder, the world continued to putter along, knowing that the US had planted demolition charges in its digital infrastructure, but praying that the \"rules-based international order\" would stop America from pushing the button. Now, more than a decade into the Trump era, the world is finally confronting the reality that they need to get the hell off of American IT, and transition to open, transparent and verifiable alternatives for their administrative tools, telecoms infrastructure and embedded systems for agriculture, industry and transportation. And not a moment too soon: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/01/39c3/#the-new-coalition But building the post-American internet is easier said than done. There remain huge, unresolved questions about the best way to proceed. One thing is clear: we will need new systems: the aforementioned open, transparent, verifiable code and hardware. That's a huge project, but the good news is that it benefits tremendously from scale, which means that as countries, businesses and households switch to the post-American internet, there will be ever more resources to devote to building, maintaining and improving this project. That's how scientific endeavors work: they're global collaborations that allow multiple parties to simultaneously attack the problems from many angles at once. Think of the global effort to sequence, understand, and produce vaccines for Covid 19. Developing the code and hardware for the post-American internet scales beautifully, making it unique among the many tasks posed by the post-American world. Other untrustworthy US platforms &#8211; such as the dollar, or the fiber links that make interconnection in the USA &#8211; are hampered by scale. The fact that hundreds of countries use the dollar and rely on US fiber connections makes replacing them harder, not easier: https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/26/difficult-multipolarism/#eurostack Building the post-American internet isn't easy, but there's a clear set of construction plans. What's far less clear is how we transition to the post-American internet. How do people, organizations and governments that currently have their data locked up in US Big Tech silos get it off their platforms and onto new, open, transparent, verifiable successors? Literally: how do you move the data from the old system to the new one, preserving things like edit/view permissions, edit histories, and other complex data-structures that often have high-stakes attached to them (for example, many organizations and governments are legally required to maintain strict view/edit permissions for sensitive data, and must preserve the histories of their documents). On top of that, there's all the systems that we use to talk to one another: media services from Instagram to Tiktok to Youtube; chat services from iMessage to Discord. It's easy enough to build alternatives to these services &#8211; indeed, they already exist, though they may require additional engineering to scale them up for hundreds of millions or billions of users &#8211; but that's only half the battle. What do we do about the literal billions of people who are already using the American systems? This is where the big divisions appear. In one camp, you have the \"if you build it, they will come\" school, who say that all we need to do is make our services so obviously superior to the legacy services that America has exported around the world and people will just switch. This is a very seductive argument. After all, the American systems are visibly, painfully defective: riddled with surveillance and ads, powered by terrible algorithms, plagued by moderation failures. But waiting for people to recognize the superiority of your alternatives and jumping ship is a dead end. It completely misapprehends the reason that users are still on legacy social media and other platforms. People don't use Instagram because they love Mark Zuckerberg; they use it because they love their friends more than they hate Mark Zuckerberg: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/30/zucksauce/#gandersauce What's more, Zuckerberg knows this. He knows that users of his service are hamstrung by the \"collective action problem\" of getting the people who matter to you to agree on when it's time to leave a service, and on which service is a safe haven to flee to: https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/29/how-to-leave-dying-social-media-platforms/ The reason Zuckerberg knows this is that he had to contend with it at the dawn of Facebook, when the majority of social media users were locked into an obviously inferior legacy platform called Myspace. Zuckerberg promised Myspace users a superior social media experience where they wouldn't be spied on or bombarded with ads: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3247362 Zuckerberg knew that wouldn't be enough. No one was going to leave Myspace for Facebook and hang out in splendid isolation, smugly re-reading Facebook's world-beating privacy policy while waiting for their dopey friends to wise up and leave Myspace to come and join them. No: Zuckerberg gave the Myspace refugees a bot, which would accept your Myspace login and password and then impersonate you to Myspace's servers several times per day, scraping all the content waiting for you in your Myspace feed and flowing it into your Facebook feed. You could reply to it there and the bot would push it out to Myspace. You could eat your cake and have it too: use Facebook, but communicate with the people who were still on Myspace. This is called \"adversarial interoperability\" and it was once the norm, but the companies that rose to power by \"moving fast and breaking things\" went on to secure legal protections to prevent anyone from doing unto them as they had done unto their own predecessors: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability The harder it is for people to leave a platform, the worse the platform can treat them without paying the penalty of losing users. This is the source of enshittification: when a company can move value from its users and customers to itself without risking their departure, it does. People stay on bad platforms because the value they provide to one another is greater than the costs the platform extracts from them. That means that when you see people stuck on a very bad platform &#8211; like Twitter, Instagram or Facebook &#8211; you should infer that what they get there from the people that matter to them is really important to them. They stick to platforms because that's where they meet with people who share their rare disease, because that's where they find the customers or audiences that they rely on to make rent; because that's the only place they can find the people they left behind when they emigrated. Now, it's entirely possible &#8211; likely, even &#8211; that legacy social media platforms will grow so terrible that people will leave and jettison those social connections that mean so much to them. This is not a good outcome. Those communities, once shattered, will likely never re-form. There will be permanent, irretrievable losses incurred by their members: https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/23/when-the-town-square-shatters/ The platforms are sinking ships. We need to evacuate them: https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/23/evacuate-the-platforms/#let-the-platforms-burn \"If you build it, they will come\" is a trap. Technologists and their users who don't understand the pernicious nature of the collective active problem trap themselves. They build obviously superior technical platforms and then gnash their teeth as the rest of the world fails to make the leap. All too often, users' frustration at the failure of new services to slay the inferior legacy services curdles, and users and designers of new technologies decide that the people who won't join them are somehow themselves defective. It doesn't take long to find a corner of the Fediverse or Bluesky where Facebook and Twitter users are being condemned as morally suspect for staying on zuckermuskian media. They are damned for loving Zuckerberg and Musk, rather than empathized with for loving each other more than they hate the oligarchs who've trapped them. They're condemned as emotionally stunted \"attention whores\" who hang out on big platforms to get \"dopamine\" (or some other pseudoscientific reward), which is easier than grappling with the fact that legacy social media pays their bills, and tolerating Zuckerberg or Musk is preferable to getting evicted. Worst of all, condemning users of legacy technology as moral failures leads you to oppose efforts to get those users out of harm's way and onto modern platforms. Think of the outcry at Meta's Threads taking steps to federate with Mastodon. There are good reasons to worry about this &#8211; the best one being that it might allow Meta to (illegally) suck up Mastodon users' data and store and process it. But the majority of the opposition to Threads integration with Mastodon wasn't about Threads' management &#8211; it was about Threads' users. It posited a certain kind of moral defective who would use a Zuckerberg-controlled platform in the 2020s and insisted that those people would ruin Mastodon by bringing over their illegitimate social practices. I've made no secret of where I come down in this debate: the owners of legacy social media are my enemy, but the users of those platforms are my comrades, and I want to help them get shut of legacy social media as quickly and painlessly as possible. What's more, there's a way to make this happen! The same adversarial interoperability that served Zuckerberg so well when he was draining users off of Myspace could be used today to evacuate all of Meta's platforms. We could use a combination of on-device bridging, scraping and other guerrilla tactics to create \"alt clients\" that let you interact with people on Mastodon and the legacy platforms in one context, so that you can leave the bad services but keep the good people in your life. The major barrier to this isn't technological. Despite the boasts of these companies to world-beating engineering prowess, the reality that people (often teenagers) keep successfully finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in the \"impregnable\" platforms, in order to build successful alt clients: https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/07/blue-bubbles-for-all/#never-underestimate-the-determination-of-a-kid-who-is-time-rich-and-cash-poor The thing that eventually sees off these alt clients isn't Big Tech's technical countermeasures &#8211; it's legal risk. A global system of \"anticircumvention\" laws makes the kinds of basic reverse-engineering associated with building and maintaining using adversarial interoperability radioactively illegal. These laws didn't appear out of thin air, either: the US Trade Representative pressured all of America's trading partners into passing them: https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/15/radical-extremists/#sex-pest Which brings me back to crises precipitating change. Trump has staged an unscheduled, sudden, midair disassembly of the global system of trade, whacking tariffs on every country in the world, even in defiance of the Supreme Court: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd6zn3ly22yo Ironically, this has only helped make the case for adversarial interoperability. Trump is using tech companies to attack his geopolitical rivals, ordering Microsoft to shut down both the International Criminal Court and a Brazilian high court in retaliation for their pursuit of the criminal dictators Benjamin Netanyahu and Jair Bolsonaro. This means that Trump has violated the quid pro quo deal for keeping anticircumvention law on your statute books, and he has made the case for killing anticircumvention as quickly as possible in order to escape American tech platforms before they are weaponized against you: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/29/post-american-canada/#ottawa I've been talking about this for more than a year now, and I must say, the reception has been better than I dared dream. I think that &#8211; for the first time in my adult life &#8211; we are on the verge of creating a new, good, billionaire-proof internet: https://pluralistic.net/2026/01/15/how-the-light-gets-in/ But there's one objection that keeps coming up: \"What if this makes Trump mad?\" Or, more specifically, \"What if this makes Trump more mad, so instead of hitting us with a 10% tariff, it's a 1,000% tariff? This came up earlier this week, when I gave a remote keynote for the Fedimtl conference, and an audience member said that he thought we should just focus on building good new platforms, rather than risking Trump's ire. In my response, I recited the arguments I've raised in this piece. But yesterday, I saw a news item that made me realize there was one more argument I should have made, but missed. It was a Reuters story about Trump ordering American diplomats to fight against \"data sovereignty\" policies around the world: https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-orders-diplomats-fight-data-sovereignty-initiatives-2026-02-25/ The news comes from a leaked diplomatic cable, and it's a reminder that Trump's goal is to maintain American dominance of the world's technology and to prevent the formation of a post-American internet altogether. Worrying that Trump will hit you with more tariffs if you legalize jailbreaking assumes that the thing that would upset Trump is that you broke the rules. That's not what makes Trump angry. What makes Trump angry is losing. Say you focus exclusively on building superior platforms. Say by some miracle that everyone you care about somehow overcomes the collective action problems and high switching costs and leaves behind US Big Tech services and comes to your new, federated, cleantech, post-American alternative. Do you think that Trump will observe this collapse in the fortunes of the most important corporations in his coalition and shrug and say, \"Well, I guess I lost fair and square; better luck next time?\" Hell, no. We already know what Trump does when his corporate allies lose to a superior foreign rival &#8211; Trump steals the rival's service and gives it to one of his cronies. That's literally what he last month, to Tiktok: https://www.democracynow.org/2026/1/23/headlines/larry_ellisons_oracle_part_of_new_deal_to_own_us_version_of_tiktok The fear of harsh retaliation for any country that dares to be a Disenshittification Nation is based on the premise that Trump is motivated by a commitment to fairness.

Apple will continue to offer 14-inch and 16-inch size options, both of which should come in M5 Pro and M5 Max varieties.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>M5 Max and M5 Pro Chip</h2>\n<br />\nWe already got the base model 14-inch &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with the new M5 chip in October, so what we're expecting are upgraded 14-inch and 16-inch models with M5 Pro and M5 Max chips.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe M5 family is built on a more advanced N3P 3-nanometer process from TSMC, and it offers speed and efficiency improvements. The M5 chip is up to 20 percent faster in multi-core CPU performance than the M4 chip, and we could see similar improvements for the M5 Pro and M5 Max chip options. GPU performance is up to 30 percent faster.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nWith the M5, Apple added a Neural Accelerator to each GPU core, improving the speeds of GPU-based AI workloads. The chip also supports third-generation ray-tracing, second-generation dynamic caching, and enhanced shader cores. \n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe 16-core Neural Engine is more energy efficient than before, and unified memory bandwidth has improved significantly. These are all features that we're likely to see with the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips as well.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Other Possible Updates</h2>\n<br />\nWe haven't heard rumors about any other features coming to the &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; line. Apple did update SSD speeds for the M5 &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models, so we could see the same upgrade to the M5 Pro and M5 Max machines.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Why You Shouldn't Buy an M5 Pro/Max MacBook Pro</h2>\n<br />\nIf you're not in serious need of a new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; right away, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/10/macbook-pro-buying-advice-2026/\">early 2026 is a bad time to upgrade</a>. The next-generation &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; after the early 2026 models is expected to feature an OLED display and touchscreen capabilities, both of which will mark a major upgrade in display quality. It's expected to include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> instead of a notch, and macOS will be optimized for touch interactions.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nMost people shelling out extra money for a &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; with a higher-end M5 Pro or M5 Max chip need the extra performance or display quality, so it is worth waiting for the huge update that's coming.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nThe transition to OLED will also likely bring a design update along with M6 Pro and M6 Max chip technology, which is another reason to wait.\n<br />\n\n<br />\nOf course, the new features could be limited to higher-end &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models or could be significantly more expensive. If you're on a budget, need a Mac now, or don't care about OLED, the M5 Pro and Max models could still be worth considering.\n<br />\n\n<br />\n<h2>Launch Date</h2>\n<br />\nThe new &zwnj;MacBook Pro&zwnj; models could be announced via press release next week ahead of Apple's Special Experience.<div class=\"linkback\">Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">MacBook Pro (Caution)</a></div><div class=\"linkback\">Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/25/m5-pro-max-macbook-pro-rumors/\">M5 Pro and M5 Max MacBook Pro: What to Expect</a>&quot; first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m5-pro-and-m5-max-macbook-pro-what-to-expect.2478235/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />",

The standout feature here is likely the size. Most modular smartphone concepts start bulky and only get bulkier once attaching accessories. Tecno's base smartphone is just 4.9mm thin, which is significantly thinner than a pencil <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\"><ins>and the iPhone Air</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, the size increases with each attached module. However, snapping on the power bank module makes the thickness comparable to a standard modern smartphone. Another key feature here is how these various modular components stick together. Tecno has developed new interconnection technology that uses both magnets and pin connectors. This should make it easy to both attach and remove components.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The company says this phone has been designed to grow with the user through hardware expansion. To that end, Tecno has developed 10 modules. There are various camera lenses and something that looks like a dedicated gaming controller.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"People holding phones.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/9f4ae160-127e-11f1-b47f-ea3488490078\" style=\"height: 1198px; width: 2128px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Tecno</div></figure>\n<p>While the magnets are for attaching, the pin connectors assist with power delivery. Data transmission between the phone and the modules is handled wirelessly, with the ability to switch between Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and mmWave depending on where the user is located.</p>\n<p>There are two colorways for both the phone and the ecosystem of accessories. There's a silver-aluminum edition and a nifty-looking grey version. This doesn't matter to actual consumers because, well, it's just a concept design. It does look like the company's magnetic attachment technology could make it to some actual products down the line.</p>\n<div id=\"d85fd27b5c524d718b50aaf44e728dfe\"></div>\n<p>Tecno has always been a company that marched to the beat of its own drummer. It has developed a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tecno-phantom-v-fold-pricing-availability-mwc-2023-174526995.html\"><ins>surprisingly affordable foldable phone</ins></a>, a model with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tecno-phantom-x2-pro-retractable-portrait-lens-113011384.html\"><ins>pop-out portrait lens</ins></a> and a foldable with a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tecnos-phantom-v-flip-phone-puts-a-circular-display-on-its-cover-090836663.html\"><ins>novel circular display on the exterior</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>The industry hasn't quite embraced modular smartphones just yet, even though there have been some nifty concept designs. Google's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-03-project-ara-video-update.html\"><ins>Project Ara prototype</ins></a> goes back more than a decade, and the same can be said of <a href=\"https://www.designboom.com/technology/phonebloks-a-modular-customizable-smartphone/\"><ins>other concept designs</ins></a> that never saw the light of day.</p>\n<p>There have been some modular phones released to the real world, but they weren't nearly as ambitious as Tecno's concept. LG launched a semi-modular phone <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-11-lg-g5-review.html\"><ins>called the G5 back in 2016</ins></a>, but it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/21/13362240/lg-g5-abandoning-modular-phone-android-strategy\"><ins>didn't move too many units</ins></a>.
