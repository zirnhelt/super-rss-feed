Like the vacuum cleaner with which it shares the first part of its name, the handle measures just 1.5 inches in diameter from top to bottom, and the whole thing weighs little more than 2kg.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The ultra-thin design allows the cleaner to lie almost completely flat, allowing you to get into tight corners or under low furniture, where more traditionally bulky devices might struggle. Its slender proportions also make it easier to store if your home is on the smaller side.</p>\n<p>Dyson says the PencilWash only applies fresh water to floors, and after swiftly eliminating spills and stains it should dry up pretty quickly. Its high-density microfiber roller is designed to tackle both wet and dry debris in one pass, and because it doesn’t have a traditional filter, you won’t have to worry about trapped dirt or lingering smells.</p>\n<p>Above the power buttons there’s a screen displaying remaining battery level, and the handle can be slotted into a charging dock when not in use.</p>\n<p>The Dyson PencilVac will cost $349, with a release date yet to be announced.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/dyson-announces-the-pencilwash-wet-floor-cleaner-230152299.html?src=rss",

With the code <strong>MONARCHVIP</strong>, you’ll pay $50 for one year of access instead of the usual $100.</p>\n<p>We’ve recommended Monarch before for its deep customization options and robust financial planning tools. It supports unlimited account connections, investment tracking and shared budgets, making it a solid option if you want a detailed look at your finances or plan alongside a partner. It also features prominently in our roundup of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html\" target=\"_blank\">best budgeting apps</a>, where it stood out for its depth and flexibility.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Monarch Money is the kind of budgeting app that can feel a little overwhelming at first, especially when you’re setting up categories, rules and recurring transactions. There’s a bit of a learning curve, and some of the finer details are easier to manage on the web than in the mobile app. But once you’re past that initial setup, it starts to make a lot more sense and becomes a powerful tool for keeping tabs on your finances.</p>\n<p>Where Monarch Money really shines is in the level of detail it offers. It’s built for people who want a clear, structured view of their money, not just a running list of transactions. In the budgeting section, you can see budgets versus actual spending by category, along with forecasts by month or by year. Recurring expenses can also be defined using more than just merchant names, which helps keep things accurate with less manual cleanup.</p>\n<p>Beyond day-to-day budgeting, Monarch does a good job of showing the bigger picture. It includes visual reports and charts that make it easier to spot trends over time, plus tools for tracking net worth, investments and financial goals. Monarch can even factor in non-cash assets like your home or vehicle, pulling in estimates automatically so they appear alongside your accounts.</p>\n<p>All of that depth won’t be for everyone, but if you’re willing to spend a little time getting set up, <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cdb5dc60-4d5b-4ea6-ab0e-4cd9b4317487&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNkYjVkYzYwLTRkNWItNGVhNi1hYjBlLTRjZDliNDMxNzQ4NyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUr_Hrzd-ATtIoKDgyQrhn4aUjoS3cxe7UAkFHc9DJ7Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Monarch Money</a> offers a lot of control and insight.

In fact, the Marco Polo launched two years before the Nugget and four years before the Westfalia-converted Volkswagen California. Now, Mercedes follows Volkswagen in leaving Westfalia behind and pulling its small camper van production entirely in-house. So, more literally than any other vehicle on the planet, the newly updated 2026 Marco Polo is the Mercedes of RV life.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/2026-mercedes-marco-polo-camper-van/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/\">Campervans</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/adventure-vehicles/\">Adventure Vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/outdoors/\">Outdoors</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/mini-campervan/\" rel=\"tag\">mini-campervan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/campervan/\" rel=\"tag\">Campervan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/mercedes-benz/\" rel=\"tag\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/mercedes/\" rel=\"tag\">Mercedes</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/\" rel=\"tag\">RV</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/\" rel=\"tag\">Outdoors and Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/\" rel=\"tag\">Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/smart-rv/\" rel=\"tag\">smart RV</a></p>",

This is the hot new trend in air travel: pulling out all the stops to cater to the wealthy.</p>\n\t<p>Airlines are adding suites with more bed space, privacy doors, an extra ottoman for guests. They&#8217;re offering caviar, free PJs, luxury skin care products, and multi-course meals with wine pairings made by gourmet chefs. They&#8217;re also building more airport lounges. Meanwhile, economy is getting more cramped and low-cost carriers are going bankrupt. It&#8217;s because wealthy passengers are where the money&#8217;s at.</p>\n\t<p>For years, airlines have made more money from their credit cards than from actually flying passengers around. And these days, premium seating is bringing in more revenue than the economy cabin. It&#8217;s a perfect example of the K-shaped economy.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kshaped-economy-spending-income-inequality-dfa59144ecb2e1b674242666e28ff556\">an AP article about the K-shaped economy</a> from late last year.</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers.</p></blockquote>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/business\">business</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/economics\">economics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>",

That’s still very much <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-show-could-kick-off-in-ancient-rome-200238552.html\">happening</a>, but the streaming giant is also now buying up rights for board game IP too, with the latest being Asmodee’s <em>Ticket to Ride</em>.</p>\n<p>Netflix will look to greenlight a number of projects spanning TV, film and &quot;additional formats,&quot; it wrote in a press release. The first of these will be a feature film written by Ben Mekler and Chris Amick. <em>Ticket to Ride </em>creator Alan R. Moon will serve as an executive producer on the project, which will be the game’s first on-screen adaptation. Exactly what it will look like is not yet clear, but the internet already has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1r78sau/netflix_developing_ticket_to_ride_movie/\"><ins>plenty</ins></a> of theories.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Ticket to Ride</em> is a train-themed turn-based strategy and route-building game first released over 20 years ago. Since then it has gone on to ship more than 20 million copies and has been translated into over 30 languages. It’s also been given the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-12-ticket-to-ride-tabletop-ps4-playlink-mobile.html\"><ins>video game</ins></a> adaptation treatment before.</p>\n<p>This is actually the second of Asmodee’s IP that Netflix has acquired the rights to, after announcing last year that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-adapting-catan-into-movies-and-tv-shows-185133712.html\"><em><ins>Catan</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>will also be making its way to screens in various forms.

She&#8217;s looking into the future. So I&#8217;m a future man, I said to her.&#8221;</li>\n\t<li>His nominees for a stacked cabinet: Duke Ellington (minister of foreign affairs), Charlie Mingus (minister of peace), Peggy Lee (minister of labor), Malcolm X (minister of justice), Louis Armstrong (minister of agriculture), Ray Charles (Librarian of Congress), and Miles Davis (head of the CIA). Of Davis, Gillespie said: &#8220;O-o-oh, honey, you know his schtick. He&#8217;s ready for that position. He&#8217;d know just what to do in that position.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\t<p>Gillespie dropped out before the election, paving the way for Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s victory over Barry Goldwater, who Gillespie said &#8220;wants to take us back to the horse­-and-buggy days when we are in the space age&#8221;.\n</p>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Dizzy%20Gillespie\">Dizzy Gillespie</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a></p>",

Meta-owned Instagram and Facebook currently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-announces-paid-subscriptions-for-both-instagram-and-facebook-in-the-uk-140913304.html\">offer a similar feature</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchat-gives-parents-more-info-on-who-their-kids-are-talking-to-120000077.html\">Snapchat</a>, creator subscriptions will give users access to exclusive content across Snaps and Stories. They will also get priority replies and go ad-free on stories. Snapchat pitches the new feature as great way to give creators &quot;freedom to experiment&quot; and &quot;build a recurring income stream&quot; — all good things for keeping people on your platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Creators can choose exactly how much they want to charge subscribers per month. They can spread these figures out across Snapchat's recommended tiers.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Snapchat creator subscriptions.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/2c68e5a0-0c13-11f1-bff8-7c48ace275c1\" style=\"height: 1000px; width: 562px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Snap</div></figure>\n<p>Starting February 23, select US-based Snapchat creators will be able to offer subscriptions. In the US, iOS users should then be able to subscribe to their accounts. The feature should expand to Canada, France, and the UK in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchat-is-rolling-out-creator-subscriptions-152114731.html?src=rss",

That’s where Apple’s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFH9BST&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b81fb587-99ff-4a0a-8491-b9b9460d3e9a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=iPhone+Air+MagSafe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjgxZmI1ODctOTlmZi00YTBhLTg0OTEtYjliOTQ2MGQzZTlhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1QiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR9o3Bk1eGEoY_MpvpdVaX8WwrXHv-kJY6NrXwaRfhTy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFH9BST\">iPhone Air MagSafe</a> battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.
