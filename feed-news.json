That's a wacky enough concept in the first place, but the site apparently exposed the credentials for thousands of its human users. The flaw was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.wiz.io/blog/exposed-moltbook-database-reveals-millions-of-api-keys\" target=\"_blank\">discovered</a> by cybersecurity firm Wiz, and its team assisted Moltbook with addressing the vulnerability. </p><p>The issue appears to be the result of the entire Reddit-style forum being vibe-coded; Moltbook's human founder <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/mattprd/status/2017386365756072376\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> a few days ago on X that he &quot;didn't write one line of code&quot; for the platform and instead directed an AI assistant to create the whole setup.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the blog post from Wiz analyzing the issue, Moltbook had a vulnerability that allowed for &quot;1.5 million API authentication tokens, 35,000 email addresses and private messages between agents&quot; to be fully read and accessed. Wiz also found that the vulnerability could let unauthenticated human users edit live Moltbook posts. In other words, there is no way to verify whether a Moltbook post was authored by an AI agent or a human user posing as one. &quot;The revolutionary AI social network was largely humans operating fleets of bots,&quot; the company's analysis concluded.&nbsp;</p><p>So ends another cautionary tale reminding us that just because AI can do a task doesn’t mean it'll do it correctly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/moltbook-the-ai-social-network-exposed-human-credentials-due-to-vibe-coded-security-flaw-230324567.html?src=rss",

The merger will “form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” Musk wrote in an update.</p><p>The AI company that right now is best known for its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html\" target=\"_blank\">CSAM-generating chatbot</a> might seem like a strange fit for a rocket company. But SpaceX is key to Musk’s latest scheme to build AI data centers in space. In his update, Musk wrote that “global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions” and that moving the resource-intensive operations to space is “the only logical solution.” SpaceX just days ago filed an application with the FCC to create an “<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-wants-to-launch-a-constellation-of-a-million-satellites-to-power-ai-needs-175607771.html\" target=\"_blank\">orbital data center</a>” by launching a million new satellites.</p><p>Musk also claimed that, eventually, space-based data centers will enable other advancements in space travel. “The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe.” Notably, it’s not the first time Musk has made lofty claims about Mars. He predicted <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-29-space-x-mars-bfr-elon-musk.html\" target=\"_blank\">in 2017</a> that SpaceX would send crewed missions to Mars by 2024. </p><p>This also isn’t the first time Musk has acquired one of his own companies. He <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xai-elon-musks-ai-company-just-purchased-x-elon-musks-social-media-company-221503759.html\" target=\"_blank\">merged xAI and X</a> last year, which means SpaceX now owns the social network Musk bought in 2022. And he recently announced that Tesla was investing <a class=\"no-affiliate-link link\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/tesla-to-invest-2-billion-in-xai-elon-musks-openai-competitor.html\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion</a> into xAI. SpaceX is planning to go public later this year in an initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at more than $1 trillion, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/elon-musk-s-spacex-said-to-combine-with-xai-ahead-of-mega-ipo\" target=\"_blank\">according to</a> <em>Bloomberg, </em>which notes that SpaceX has also “discussed a possible merger with Tesla.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-spacex-has-acquired-his-ai-company-xai-221617040.html?src=rss",

We have a clear Code of Conduct that outlines our shared expectations for working together safely and respectfully, which employees review and sign each year. When that is breached, our established procedures apply, including an escalation of measures depending on the nature, severity, and repetition of the breach.&quot; We've reached out to the company for additional confirmation and comment.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the latest in a sequence of bad press Ubisoft has faced regarding its workforce. Shortly after many employees at Ubisoft Halifax unionized, the parent company <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-a-studio-16-days-after-it-unionized-183000983.html\" target=\"_blank\">shut down</a> the studio. In announcing the closure, Ubisoft said the move was part of a broader cost-cutting endeavor across its operations; it shut down a support studio and cut more jobs <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html\" target=\"_blank\">later in January</a>, with even more layoffs <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-proposes-even-more-layoffs-after-last-weeks-studio-closures-and-game-cancellations-192703241.html\" target=\"_blank\">proposed</a>. Most recently, unions representing other Ubisoft workers called for <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-173241918.html\" target=\"_blank\">a three-day strike</a> in response to the &quot;penny-pinching and worsening our working conditions&quot; they alleged of the company's management.</p><p>All these issues could all be coincidental timing.

As its government advances a proposed ban on social media use for anyone under age 15, some leaders are already looking to add further restrictions. During an <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VfMKmeHnrM\" target=\"_blank\">appearance</a> on public broadcast service Franceinfo, Minister Delegate for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Affairs Anne Le Hénanff said VPNs might be the next target.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;If [this legislation] allows us to protect a very large majority of children, we will continue. And VPNs are the next topic on my list,&quot; she <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/vpns-are-next-on-my-list-france-set-to-evaluate-vpn-use-following-social-media-ban-for-under-15s\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>.</p><p>A virtual private network would potentially allow French citizens younger than 15 to circumnavigate the social media ban. We've already seen VPN's experience <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/vpns-are-booming-in-the-uk-after-age-restriction-laws-but-free-options-carry-big-risks-060036636.html\" target=\"_blank\">a popularity spike in the UK</a> last year after similar laws were passed over age-gating content. However, a VPN also offers benefits for online privacy, and introducing age verification requirements where your personal data must be submitted negates a large part of these services' appeal.&nbsp;</p><p>The French social media ban is still a work in progress. France's National Assembly <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/frances-national-assembly-debates-banning-under-15s-social-media-2026-01-26/\" target=\"_blank\">voted in favor</a> of the restrictions last week with a result of 116-23, moving it ahead for discussion in the country's Senate. While a single comment doesn't mean that France will in fact ban VPNs for any demographic, it does point to the direction some of the country's leaders want to take. Critics responded to Le Hénanff's statements with worry that these attempts at protective measures were veering into an authoritarian direction.&nbsp;</p><p>The actions in France echo several other legislative pushes around the world aimed at reducing children and teens' access to social media and other potentially sensitive content online. The US had seen <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-year-age-verification-laws-came-for-the-open-internet-130000979.html\" target=\"_blank\">25 state-level laws</a> for age verification introduced in the past two years, which has created a new set of concerns around users' privacy and personal data, particularly when there has been no attempt to standardize how that information will be collected or protected. When data breaches at large corporations are already all too common, it's hard to trust that the individual sites and services that suddenly need to build an age verification process won't be an easy target for hacks.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/france-might-seek-restrictions-on-vpn-use-in-campaign-to-keep-minors-off-social-media-205308716.html?src=rss",

The Huayuan biota yields remarkable taxonomic richness, comprising 153 animal species of 16 phylum-level clades dominated by arthropods, poriferans and cnidarians, among which 59% of species are new. The biota is comprised overwhelmingly of soft-bodied forms that include preserved cellular tissues.</p></blockquote>\n\nThey have identified more than 50,000 individual fossil specimens that existed during what&#8217;s referred to as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion\">Cambrian explosion</a>, &#8220;when a sudden radiation of complex life occurred and practically all major animal phyla started appearing in the fossil record&#8221;. The fossils at the site <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/dozens-of-bizarre-ancient-lifeforms-discovered-in-extraordinary-fossil-find/\">are unusually intact</a>:\n\n<blockquote><p>Not only is this ecosystem notably diverse, but the fossils have remained unusually intact in the ancient mudstone, allowing for the preservation of soft tissues like tentacles, guts, and a nearly-complete nervous system found in one arthropod.</p></blockquote>\n\nI&#8217;ve been interested in this period in paleontology since reading Stephen Jay Gould&#8217;s <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/2966/9780393307009\">Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History</a> in college. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossils_of_the_Burgess_Shale\">The Burgess Shale</a> was a significant discovery that shed much light on the Cambrian explosion and surprisingly, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/chinese-fossils-show-marine-animals-thriving-half-billion-years-ago-2026-01-28/\">paleontologists found fossils that appeared in both places</a>.\n\n<blockquote><p>The Burgess Shale animals date to about 508 million years ago, further removed from the Sinsk event than the Huayuan biota. Despite the vast distance separating the two sites, fossils of several of the same animals were found in the two locations.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;It surprised us when we found the Huayuan biota shared various animals with the Burgess Shale, including the arthropods Helmetia and Surusicaris that were previously only known from the Burgess Shale,&#8221; Zeng said.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;As larval stages are common in extant marine invertebrates, the best explanation of these shared taxa shall be that the larvae of early animals were capable of spreading by ocean currents since the early days of animals in the Cambrian,&#8221; Zeng said.</p></blockquote>\n\nFor those looking for more info on this discovery and its significance, paleontologist Dr. Joe Botting&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mJJc_bMWE0\">video on the Huayuan biota</a>, which he calls &#8220;a stunning new Burgess Shale-type fauna&#8221;, might be a good place to start. \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/paleontology\">paleontology</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/science\">science</a></p>\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/02/significant-find-of-cambrian-explosion-fossils\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>",

The retailer Power Buy posted a listing for the earbuds, complete with multiple photos and some specs.</p>\n\n<p>Let's get to the specs. We don't know a lot, but the listing does suggest the earbuds will boast an IPX4 water-resistance rating and ANC/transparency modes. None of this is all that surprising, though we don't have any details regarding the audio drivers or anything like that.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"Earbuds and a case.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/417d7370-006a-11f1-bfae-534ae38d87ac\" style=\"height: 1258px; width: 1262px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">The Walkman Blog / Power Buy / Sony</div></figure>\n<p>We do know what they look like, assuming the listing is accurate. There are two colorways, black and white, with a pill-shaped design that differs from the previous iterations. The case looks like a standard earbud case.</p>\n<p>One interesting design aspect is that the eartips are slightly bigger than with previous models. This could indicate a larger air channel, which would translate to an increased bass response. Earbuds tend to struggle with bass, so this could be a nifty little upgrade.</p>\n<p>However, that's conjecture and we won't know more until Sony does its own official drop. It's been well over two years since the company released the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review-striving-for-perfection-160023581.html\"><ins>WF-1000XM5 earbuds</ins></a>, so the refresh is long overdue.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sonys-flagship-wf-1000xm6-earbuds-have-been-leaked-on-a-retail-site-194146960.html?src=rss",

ROG says it was designed to please gamers who &quot;demand absolute clarity, precision and realism.&quot; The headphones feature 100mm planar magnetic drivers that have been &quot;tuned specifically for gaming.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"e395c14b0a4948ef8c9cd9322ceb32af\"></div>\n<p>The company says this results in a wide frequency response, low distortion and a &quot;level of detail that reveals subtle positional cues such as footsteps, reloads and distance movement.&quot; ROG boasts that these audio cues remain distinct even during moments of chaotic gameplay, potentially making the headphones a great choice for competitive gamers.</p>\n<p>The open-back design allows for clear separation across bass, mids and treble, which should also make the headphones great for listening to music. It features a full-band boom microphone with a high signal-to-noise ratio. There are separate signal paths for audio and microphone inputs, which significantly reduces crosstalk.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The stuff that comes in the box.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/1423dbe0-0064-11f1-bbcf-05597ffed6e5\" style=\"height: 982px; width: 1514px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">ASUS ROG</div></figure>\n<p>The headphones have been built for maximum versatility, so there's a balanced headphone cable with swappable plugs.

What started life as the company's response to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-new-claude-model-can-think-both-fast-and-slow-203307140.html\" target=\"_blank\">Claude Code</a> is becoming <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-codex-app/\" target=\"_blank\">something more sophisticated</a> with the release of a new dedicated macOS app. At its most basic form, Codex is a programming agent capable of writing code for users, but now it can also manage multiple AI assistants that can work together to complete more complex tasks.</p><p>OpenAI gives an example of how this could work in practice. The company used Codex to create a Mario Kart-like racing game, complete with a selection of different playable cars, eight tracks and a collection of powerups players can use against the competition. For a single AI agent, generating a game from scratch, with all the needed visual assets, would be a tough ask, but Codex was able to complete the task because it could delegate the work of making the game to different models with complementary capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, it turned to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-image-generation-is-now-faster-and-better-at-following-tweaks-180000750.html\" target=\"_blank\">GPT Image</a> for the visual assets, while a separate model simultaneously coded the web game. &quot;It took on the roles of designer, game developer and QA tester to validate its work by actually playing the game,&quot; OpenAI says of the process.&nbsp;</p><p>If that sounds complicated, OpenAI has tried to make it more approachable with a section of the app titled Skills. The feature bundles “instructions, resources, and scripts so Codex can reliably connect to tools, run workflows, and complete tasks according to your team’s preferences,&quot; the company explains. &quot;The Codex app includes a dedicated interface to create and manage skills. You can explicitly ask Codex to use specific skills, or let it automatically use them based on the task at hand.&quot;</p><p>As you might imagine, Codex can also automate repetitive tasks. A dedicated Automations section of the app allows you to schedule tasks, which the software will complete in the background. &quot;At OpenAI, we’ve been using Automations to handle the repetitive but important tasks, like daily issue triage, finding and summarizing CI failures, generating daily release briefs, checking for bugs, and more,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p><p>The release of the Codex macOS app comes as AI startups explore what a group of AI agents working in parallel can accomplish. At the start of the year, Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://cursor.com/blog/scaling-agents\" target=\"_blank\">found</a> it was possible to build a working web browser from scratch using such an approach, though it did encounter problems along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>For a limited time, OpenAI is making Codex available to ChatGPT Free and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt-192831449.html\" target=\"_blank\">Go users</a> so they can see what's possible with this new software. At the same time, the company is doubling rates for Plus and Pro subscribers. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-brings-its-codex-coding-app-to-mac-with-new-multi-agent-abilities-included-183103262.html?src=rss",

Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Acme License-Plate Maker; IPV4 delenda est; Mandatory gun-ownership; Sukey; Ross and Carrie x LRH; Criti-hype. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Stock swindles (permalink) There are plenty of American historical antecedents of Trumpism &#8211; fascist movements like the Jim Crow reign of terror, the McCarthy hearings, the gleeful genocide of indigenous people. But when you're thinking about the rise of Trumpism, never forget that America isn't just a nation of cruel bigots; it's also a nation of rich swindlers. We call Trump a \"reality TV star\" and it's true, as far as it goes. Trump did play a billionaire on TV long before he grifted actual billions, using his status as the poor man's idea of a rich man to secure liar loans and rip off creditors, contractors, business partners, workers, and governments &#8211; local, state and federal. He rose to power on this, boasting on stage that cheating \"makes me smart\": https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/04/its-not-a-lie/#its-a-premature-truth Like so many crooked officials, Trump's brand is \"He steals, but he works\" (except of course that he doesn't &#8211; at any given moment, odds are that he's either taking a nap, watching Fox News, or playing golf): https://www.reddit.com/r/AskBalkans/comments/utui8s/in_romania_we_have_a_saying_about_corrupt/ Remember: the right is the movement that says that governments are inefficient and corrupt, so right wing elected leaders make their own case by being incompetent and corrupt. Someone like Trump has to convince people that they can't rely on institutions or their neighbors. His path to power lies through convincing people that the system is rigged and that he &#8211; as a man who is an expert at cheating &#8211; knows how to rig it in your favor: https://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/trumps-rigged-claim/ But merely claiming \"the system is rigged\" doesn't actually win the day. If you want to convince people that the system is rigged, it really helps if the system is actually rigged. Want to convince people that elections are corrupt? Legalize unlimited dark money spending and fill our polling places with defective, unauditable voting machines made by Beltway Bandits selling into no-bid contracts: https://web.archive.org/web/20210203113531/https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/02/03/voting-machines-election-steal-conspiracy-flaws/ Want to convince people that there's a shadowy cabal of rich pedophiles hiding children in a pizza parlor basement? It helps if there's an actual cabal of rich pedophiles hanging out on a private island, abusing more than a thousand children (and counting). Want to convince people that the financial system is a rigged casino so you might as well just gamble on cryptocurrency and betting markets? It helps if the actual financial system is run by banks who receive billions in public money and then steal millions of Americans' homes after Obama takes Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's advice to \"foam the runways\" for the banks using Americans' houses: https://keystoneky.com/article/all-we-can-do-is-put-foam-on-the-runway-tim-geithner-speaking-before-the-collapse-of-lehman/ Which is all to say, if you want to understand the origins of the surge of suckers for fascists who are desperate for a strong man to cheat on their behalf in a rigged system, it helps to look beyond racism and xenophobia, to the ways in which the system is, indeed, rigged. Racism and misogyny alone aren't enough to bring about fascism. To groom a nation of fascist patsies, you first need a crooked system: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/22/all-day-suckers/#i-love-the-poorly-educated This is why it's worth understanding finance. The finance sector hides its sins behind the Shield of Boringness (h/t Claire Evans). The layers of overlapping jargon and performative complexity make it hard for everyday people to criticize the finance sector. Finance ghouls exploit this, leveraging confusing ambiguities in the system to insist that their critics don't know what they're talking about and that everything is fine, actually. This is an incredibly destabilizing dynamic. Living in a system where you're being fleeced every day but where people who seem smarter than you have reasonable-seeming explanations about why it's all legit and above-board is a recipe for abandoning all faith in the system, in experts, and in lawful processes, and throw your lot in with a strongman who promises to cheat on your behalf. Take stock buybacks, a form of stock swindle that was illegal until 1982. In a stock buyback, a company buys its own shares on the open market. When the number of shares goes down, the price per share goes up. This is just a form of \"wash-trading,\" like when NFT and shitcoin scammers buy their own products in order to make it look like they're valuable and desirable: https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/06/computer-says-huh/#invisible-handcuffs Advocates for markets as a system of allocation (as opposed to allocating via a democratically accountable state, say) insist that markets are efficient because prices \"encode information\" about the desirability, viability, and other qualities of goods and services. This is the whole argument for the new crop of rigged casinos we call \"prediction markets\" that are grooming the next generation of fascist footsoldiers by robbing them blind and then insisting that the whole process was not only legitimate, but scientific, a way to retrieve the \"encoded information\" about the world around us. In a market system, stock prices are supposed to reflect the aggregated information about the health and prospects of a company. When a company buys its own stock back, though, its price goes up while its value goes down. I mean that literally: say a company that's sitting on a billion dollars cash is valued at $10 billion. From this, we can infer that the company's capital stock (factories, inventory, etc), IP (patents, processes, copyrights, etc) and human capital (payrolled employees, contractors) are worth $9 billion. That's a reliable estimate, because we know exactly how much one billion dollars cash is worth: it's worth one billion dollars. Now, let that company piss that billion dollars up the wall with a stock buyback. The company is relieved of its billion dollars cash on hand, leaving it with no cash, only its physical capital, IP and human capital, which are worth $9b. The company is now worth less than it was before the stock buyback. What's more, the drop in corporate valuation is more than the billion the company just blew on its buyback. A company with no cash reserves is brittle and prone to failures. Without a cash cushion, any rent shock, change in market conditions, or other adverse incident will leave the company scrambling to borrow money (at punitive rates, thanks to its desperation) to weather the storm. If share prices are actually \"encoding information\" about a company's worth, a billion dollar buyback should lop more than a billion dollars off the company's share price. Instead, it sends the share price up. This is just stock manipulation, which is why it was illegal until 1982. But apologists for this system will tell you that a stock buyback is just a dividend by another name &#8211; just another way for a company to return value to its shareholders, who, after all, are the owners of the company and entitled to extract those profits. This is categorically untrue. Dividends do take money out of the company's coffers and distribute them to its shareholders, sure &#8211; but a dividend is a bet on the company's future success, which is why a company's share prices rise after a dividend is declared. Investors observe a company that is so well-run that it can afford to drain some of its cash reserves in favor of its shareholders, so they buy the company's stock in anticipation of more dividends derived from more skilled operations. But imagine if a company parted with a dividend so large that it meant that the firm would struggle to keep its doors open in the coming year. Imagine a publisher, say, whose dividend was so large that it couldn't afford to pay advances for any more books in the next season, meaning it could only make money from the backlist titles it already had in the warehouse, but was entirely out of the running when it came to publishing next year's blockbuster book. That dividend would not send investors chasing the company's stock. Why would you bet on a stock whose management had just doomed the company to a bad season, and maybe an unrecoverable death-spiral? Without new books to sell, the company won't have any cash to pay dividends, and when it stops paying dividends, its stock price will fall, leaving shareholders with a hole in their own balance-sheets. Contrast that with buybacks: to do a buyback, the company need merely spend its free cash flow, or money it borrows, or money derived from the sale of key capital, or money saved through mass layoffs, to buy its own stock. Then the share price goes up. In other words: when a company's stock price rises on news of a dividend, that's \"encoding information\" about the market's confidence in the company's management and its future growth. When a company's stock price rises on news of a buyback, that's \"encoding information\" about the market's confidence in the company's future looting to the point of collapse. I used to think that this was the whole stock buyback story, but as is ever the case with finance, buybacks are fractally corrupt. This week, I've been reading Boston College law prof Ray D Madoff's book The Second Estate: How the Tax Code Made an American Aristocracy, and I've learned even more scummy truths about buybacks: https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo256019296.html For tax purposes, dividends are \"ordinary income,\" meaning that they are taxed at up to 37%. Meanwhile, if you sell your shares after a stock buyback juices the price, the profits are treated as \"capital gains,\" whose tax rate caps out at about half that (20%). This means that shareholders pay half the tax on money that comes from strip-mining a company than they would get from money derived from managing a company for sustainable growth. It's worse than that, though, because capital gains can be offset by capital losses. If you invested in a stock that tanked, you can hold that stock in your portfolio until you are ready to sell a profitable stock, and deduct your losses from the gains you've made. But you don't even have to sell the stock to realize tax-free income from it: the ultra-rich live according to a financial arrangement called \"buy, borrow, die\" that lets them avoid all taxes. Here's how that works: if you're sitting on a bunch of stock, you can stake it as collateral for a loan that is tax-free. Better than that, if you're smart, some or all of the interest on that loan is tax-deductible. If you're rich enough, you don't have to make regular payments on the loan, either &#8211; you just wait as the stock continues to grow while your loan is maturing, and when it's due, you borrow even more money against the new valuation and pay off the old loan. That's \"buy\" and \"borrow.\" Here's \"die.\" When you die, you transfer your assets to your kids, who benefit from something called the \"step-up in basis,\" which lets them avoid all capital gains on the appreciated value of your assets. Now, maybe you're thinking that you can benefit from this arrangement. I've got bad news for you: you won't qualify for one of those cool loans that you don't need to pay regularly! What's more, if you own any stock you almost certainly own it through a retirement plan like a 401(k), and when you cash out that 401(k), that is treated as \"ordinary income\" at nearly twice the rate that our plutocrat overlords pay. Buybacks, then, are part of a system whereby rich people get much richer every time a company that makes something good and employs ordinary people guts itself and sets itself on the path to bankruptcy. Meanwhile, working people don't benefit from this system, even if they own stock. They just get to live in a world where businesses are looted and shuttered and public services are slashed thanks to balanced budget rules that mean that governments can't spend when rich people don't pay taxes. This is why buybacks have apologists. Buybacks &#8211; a stock swindle that was illegal in living memory &#8211; make rich people richer, and they spend some of that loot to fund an army of reply-ghouls who push the message that buybacks are dividends by another name. It's part of the ripoff economy that has seen crypto-billionaires lobby, bribe and terrorize lawmakers into merging their speculative assets with the real economy, endangering the economic well-being of everyday people: https://www.levernews.com/what-tech-wants-crypto-reign-of-terror/ It's part of the ripoff economy that has seen AI bros put the global market in peril with crooked accounting and empty promises: https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/ The ripoff economy is baked into the American experience. It is the foundation of Trumpism. It is the financial basis for things like \"Project 2025\" &#8211; literally! The Heritage Foundation (who created Project 2025) was founded and funded by the founders of Amway, a destructive Ponzi scheme that was rescued from criminal prosecution when Gerald Ford (Congressman to Amway's founders) became president and ordered the FTC to let them off the hook: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/05/free-enterprise-system/#amway-or-the-highway Trump's right: the system is rigged. If you're going to pull the people you love back from the nihilistic descent into fascism, you have to be able to understand and explain how the rigging works. We can't insist &#8211; as Hillary Clinton did &#8211; that \"America is already great\": https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-dem-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/03/clinton-america-is-already-great-220078 America is not great. It has been gutted by the Epstein class, who robbed us blind, raped our kids, and are now selling us shitcoins and chatbots and the spectacle of protesters being shot in the streets. But it's not enough to know that the system is rigged. Everybody knows the system is rigged. To build a movement and save our future, we have to know how it is rigged and who rigged it.

Its small size is perfect for cozying up on the couch or to use on your daily commute.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Apple released this iPad mini in late 2024 and it was a solid update. We gave it an 83 in our review thanks to the power of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-unveils-a17-pro-a-3nm-chip-powering-iphone-15-pro-182113747.html\">A17 Pro chip</a> and that it comes with a minimum of 128GB of storage.

Still, it's a good iPad with an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, Apple Intelligence and 12MP Wide back and 12MP Ultra Wide cameras.

Less than a week after companies like Oracle took <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-finalizes-deal-for-its-us-entity-010543484.html\">ownership of TikTok's domestic operations</a>, the platform faced a major power outage when one of its primary US data center sites — run by Oracle — got taken down by the storm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The problems started last Monday, January 26, when TikTok announced it was working on a &quot;major infrastructure issue&quot; and warned of bugs, time-out requests, missing earnings, and more. The next day TikTok shared that progress has been made but there were still some issues. It added, &quot;Creators may temporarily see '0' views or likes on videos, and your earnings may look like they're missing. This is a display error caused by server timeouts; your actual data and engagement are safe.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Then, yesterday, February 1, TikTok claimed the problem was straightened out and that users shouldn't experience any more related issues. &quot;We're sorry about the issues experienced by our U.S. community. We appreciate how much you count on TikTok to create, discover, and connect with what matters to you,&quot; the platform stated in its update. &quot;Thank you for your patience and understanding.&quot;</p>\n<p>A number of US users have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/people-are-uninstalling-tiktok-and-downloading-an-indie-competitor-233345222.html\">uninstalled TikTok</a> in response to its new ownership and technical issues. Some users also claimed that TikTok was censoring what they could post or what others saw. For instance, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/01/tiktok-first-week\"><em>The Guardian</em> reports</a> that many people faced issues sharing videos about ICE agents killing Alex Pretti and general anti-ICE content.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On January 26, analytics firm <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-uninstalls-are-up-150percent-following-us-joint-venture.html\">Sensor Tower told <em>CNBC</em></a> that uninstalls of the app had increased by over 150 percent during the five days since its change in ownership, when compared to the three months before. At the same time, independent app and competitor <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/\">UpScrolled</a> saw a surge in downloads.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-says-its-back-to-normal-after-winter-storm-related-outages-114848212.html?src=rss",

Some companies include fins or fit wings to help hold their in-ear earbuds in place while others opt for an over-the-ear hook on more <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html\">sporty models</a>. You’ll want to pay attention to these things to make sure they align with how you plan to use them. Also consider overall size and weight since those two factors can impact the fit. A less-than-ideal seal due to a weird fit will affect the performance of active noise-canceling earbuds.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of earbuds offer. You’ll see terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>the outside of the device to detect ambient noise. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it’s at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups or ear tips. Adaptive ANC is also better at combating wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using earbuds outdoors. For this top pick list of the best noise-canceling earbuds, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise in noisy environments.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of earbuds offers presets or adjustable levels of noise reduction. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that either provide maximum noise-blocking or prioritize energy efficiency. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-earbuds\">How we test noise-canceling earbuds</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for ANC earbuds is typically 6-10 hours, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). When necessary, I’ll power the headphones off during a review without putting them back in the case. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to wear them for an entire day.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use the earbuds in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I also use them during air travel, since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I’m not slated to hop on a flight, I simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well earbuds block human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC setups.</p> \n<p>I also do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double-checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set, and revisit the closest competition as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-earbuds-150026857.html?src=rss",
