      "content_html": "<img src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2026-02%2F619ca650-082e-11f1-b94d-2f9ac0a3e95a&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=858d6dd5d6dba346dc041c169bc09dc8fbc47ebd\" style=\"width:100%;max-height:300px;object-fit:cover;\" />\n<p>Noise-canceling earbuds have become an everyday essential for a lot of people, whether you’re trying to survive a noisy commute, concentrate in a shared workspace or just carve out a little quiet time. Advances in active noise cancellation and audio processing mean today’s best earbuds do a much better job of cutting through background noise, without forcing you to move up to bulky over-ear headphones.<br /><br />The latest models also balance sound quality with convenience, offering stable Bluetooth connections, comfortable fits and battery life that can last through a full day with help from their charging cases. From premium options with the strongest ANC to more affordable picks that still get the basics right, there’s no shortage of solid choices depending on what you value most.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-noise-cancelling-earbuds-for-2026\">Best noise-cancelling earbuds for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-noise-canceling-earbuds-for-you\">How to choose the best noise-canceling earbuds for you</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>Most true wireless earbuds these days have a “traditional” design that’s a round bud that fits in your ear canals. However, there are some variations on the formula in terms of shape, size and additional fitting elements. Some companies include fins or fit wings to help hold their in-ear earbuds in place while others opt for an over-the-ear hook on more <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html\">sporty models</a>. You’ll want to pay attention to these things to make sure they align with how you plan to use them. Also consider overall size and weight since those two factors can impact the fit. A less-than-ideal seal due to a weird fit will affect the performance of active noise-canceling earbuds.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of earbuds offer. You’ll see terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>the outside of the device to detect ambient noise. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it’s at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups or ear tips. Adaptive ANC is also better at combating wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using earbuds outdoors. For this top pick list of the best noise-canceling earbuds, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise in noisy environments.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of earbuds offers presets or adjustable levels of noise reduction. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that either provide maximum noise-blocking or prioritize energy efficiency. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-earbuds\">How we test noise-canceling earbuds</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for ANC earbuds is typically 6-10 hours, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). When necessary, I’ll power the headphones off during a review without putting them back in the case. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to wear them for an entire day.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use the earbuds in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I also use them during air travel, since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I’m not slated to hop on a flight, I simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well earbuds block human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC setups.</p> \n<p>I also do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double-checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set, and revisit the closest competition as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-earbuds-150026857.html?src=rss",

The new chapter will include not only a game but a novel and music, the company said in a <a href=\"https://blooberteam.prowly.com/446859-layers-of-fear-3-revealed-bloober-team-is-expanding-its-horror-multiverse-with-new-games-and-cross-media-content\">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The developer revealed the new IP via a live-action teaser, with an actor reading lines from William Blake's poem, <em>The Sick Rose</em>. A painting then fell from the wall, and the actor then turned over an hourglass with red sand, with a tagline stating &quot;The door won't stay closed.&quot; No gameplay or other information like the release date was revealed.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>What Bloober did say, though, is that it would launch new <em>Layer of Fear</em> non-game content, including a novel by horror writer, poet and vocalist Marta Bijan. The company also announced that it would release the soundtracks for <em>Layer of Fear,</em> <em>The Medium</em> and <em>Cronos</em> both in digital and physical (CD and vinyl) editions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new title is likely to be eagerly anticipated given Bloober's form of late. The company recently released its <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cronos-the-new-dawn-seems-to-smush-dead-space-and-control-together-in-a-good-way-172611962.html\"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></a> and a new Switch 2 <em>Layers of Fear 2</em> version called <em>Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</em>. The original <em>Layers of Fear</em> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-25-layers-of-fear-valentines-day-love-horror.html\">came out back in 2016</a> and is considered one of the better horror titles of recent years, thanks to an expertly crafted narrative and psychedelic thrills and chills. The sequel moved to a creepy ocean liner and was equally well-received.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Feb. 16, 2026 at 3:06PM ET</strong>: The headline was updated with the correct game name.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/layers-of-3-revealed-via-a-mysterious-trailer-and-poem-153021903.html?src=rss",

The app lets you connect unlimited accounts, track spending and investments, set financial goals and share access with a partner, all across web, mobile and tablet apps.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Monarch Money is the kind of budgeting app that can feel a little overwhelming at first, especially when you’re setting up categories, rules and recurring transactions. There’s a bit of a learning curve, and some of the finer details are easier to manage on the web than in the mobile app. But once you’re past that initial setup, it starts to make a lot more sense and becomes a powerful tool for keeping tabs on your finances.</p>\n<p>Where Monarch Money really shines is in the level of detail it offers. It’s built for people who want a clear, structured view of their money, not just a running list of transactions. In the budgeting section, you can see budgets versus actual spending by category, along with forecasts by month or by year. Recurring expenses can also be defined using more than just merchant names, which helps keep things accurate with less manual cleanup.</p>\n<p>Beyond day-to-day budgeting, Monarch does a good job of showing the bigger picture. It includes visual reports and charts that make it easier to spot trends over time, plus tools for tracking net worth, investments and financial goals. Monarch can even factor in non-cash assets like your home or vehicle, pulling in estimates automatically so they appear alongside your accounts.</p>\n<p>All of that depth won’t be for everyone, but if you’re willing to spend a little time getting set up, <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cdb5dc60-4d5b-4ea6-ab0e-4cd9b4317487&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNkYjVkYzYwLTRkNWItNGVhNi1hYjBlLTRjZDliNDMxNzQ4NyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUr_Hrzd-ATtIoKDgyQrhn4aUjoS3cxe7UAkFHc9DJ7Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Monarch Money</a> offers a lot of control and insight.

You don't even have to spend $500 today to get a decent handset, whether it’s a refurbished <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-iphone-160012979.html\">iPhone</a> or an affordable <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-android-phone-130030805.html\">Android phone</a>, as there are plenty of decent options as low as $160.<br /><br />However, navigating the budget phone market can be tricky; options that look good on paper may not be in practice, and some devices will end up costing you more when you consider many come with restrictive storage. While we spend most of our time reviewing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-midrange-smartphone-183006463.html\">mid-</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html\">high-end handsets</a> at Engadget, we've tested a number of the latest budget-friendly phones on the market to see cut it as the best cheap phones you can get right now.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-cheap-phones\">Best cheap phones</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-cheap-phone\">What to look for in a cheap phone</h2> \n<p>For this guide, our top picks cost between $100 and $300. Anything less and you might as well go buy a dumb phone instead. Since they’re meant to be more affordable than flagship phones and even midrange handsets, budget smartphones involve compromises; the cheaper a device, the lower your expectations around specs, performance and experience should be. For that reason, the best advice I can give is to spend as much as you can afford. In this price range, even $50 or $100 more can get you a dramatically better product.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Second, you should know what you want most from a phone. When buying a budget smartphone, you may need to sacrifice a decent main camera for long battery life, or trade a high-resolution display for a faster CPU. That’s just what comes with the territory, but knowing your priorities will make it easier to find the right phone.</p> \n<p>It’s also worth noting some features can be hard to find on cheaper handsets. For instance, you won’t need to search far for a device with all-day battery life — but if you want a phone with excellent camera quality, you’re better off shelling out for one of the recommendations in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html\">midrange smartphone guide</a>, which all come in at $600 or less.</p> \n<p>Wireless charging and waterproofing also aren’t easy to find in this price range and forget about the fastest chipset. On the bright side, most of our recommendations come with headphone jacks, so you won’t need to buy <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\">wireless headphones</a>.</p> \n<p>iOS is also off the table, since, following the discontinuation of the iPhone SE, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\">$599 iPhone 16e</a> is now the most affordable offering from Apple. That leaves Android as the only option in the under-$300 price range. Thankfully today, there’s little to complain about Google’s operating system – and you may even prefer it to iOS.</p> \n<p>Lastly, keep in mind most Android manufacturers typically offer far less robust software features and support for their budget devices. In some cases, your new phone may only receive one major software update and a year or two of security patches beyond that. That applies to the OnePlus and Motorola recommendations on our list.</p> \n<p>If you’d like to keep your phone for as long as possible, Samsung has the best software policy of any Android manufacturer in the budget space, offering at least <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-four-years-security-updates-152303907.html\"> four years of security updates</a> on all of its devices. Recently, it even began offering six years of support on the $200 A16 5G, which we recommend below. That said, if software support (or device longevity overall) is your main focus, consider spending a bit more on the $500 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-google-pixel-9a-might-be-the-new-midrange-smartphone-king-140021156.html\">Google Pixel 9a</a>, or even the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-8a-review-the-best-midrange-android-phone-gets-flagship-ai-features-140046032.html\">previous-gen Pixel 8a</a>, which has planned software updates through<a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-fold\"> mid-2031</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-phones-130017793.html?src=rss",

It can save you time and money, too, compared to buying PC components piecemeal. If you’re weighing your options, consider some Presidents Day offers on iBuyPower’s pre-built desktops, including the $1,899 RDY Element 9 Pro R07 and the $2,099.99 Slate — both of which are stocked [&#8230;]",

New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> for just $10. That's $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> \n<p>We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/disney-and-hulu-deal-get-the-bundle-for-10-for-one-month-192814789.html?src=rss",

They are, in a word, fantastic. The headphones are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html\">packed with premium features</a>, like advanced ANC. There are a whopping 12 ANC microphones throughout and a brand-new chip to power the feature. The end result? It successfully blocks background noise at medium and high frequencies, including the human voice.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction.</p> \n<p>The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The only real major nitpick here is the original asking price. It's tough to recommend any pair of headphones for $460, but a bit easier at under $400.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/grab-our-favorite-wireless-headphones-while-theyre-on-sale-for-an-all-time-low-price-175038719.html?src=rss",

The second-gen model that Apple just released <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\">outpaces the original</a> in every way (aside from the galling lack of a keyring hole, that is). While it's easy enough to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html\">replace the battery</a> in both versions of the AirTag, you might not want to have to worry about the device's battery life for a very long time. Enter Elevation Lab's extended battery case for the AirTag, which is currently <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D1LHBZGL&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=61f14f8b-e71c-4724-a1bf-0d7992632921&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=on+sale+at+Amazon+for+%2416&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDFMSEJaR0w_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjFmMTRmOGItZTcxYy00NzI0LWExYmYtMGQ3OTkyNjMyOTIxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDFMSEJaR0wiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ5tp9jRsXPC9KB06SrtQgpAFy3tN1LYQFPUDmeGSjg2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1LHBZGL\">on sale at Amazon for $16</a>.</p> \n<p>The case usually sells for $23, so that's a 30 percent discount. It's not the first time <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-extended-battery-airtag-case-is-down-to-only-16-162308748.html\">we've seen this deal</a>, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This is arguably one of the more useful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag accessories</a> around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> \n<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> \n<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-elevation-lab-airtag-10-year-extended-battery-case-is-on-sale-for-only-16-right-now-151215739.html?src=rss",

It's a project of mass violence, part of which involves total erasure and the widespread theft of some of the most culturally significant artifacts in the world. Even today, colonizing nations proudly display stolen artifacts, acting as peacocking robbers under the guise of tourism. See, for example, the [&#8230;]",

Homeland Security asked the companies for names, email addresses, telephone numbers and any other identifying detail for accounts that have criticized the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or have reported the location of its agents. Google, Meta and Reddit have  complied with some of the requests</p><p>Administrative subpoenas are different from warrants and are issued by the DHS. <em>The Times</em> says they were rarely used in the past and were mostly sent to companies for the investigation of serious crimes, such as child trafficking. Apparently, though, the government has ramped up its use in the past year. “It’s a whole other level of frequency and lack of accountability,” Steve Loney, a senior supervising attorney for ACLU, told the publication. </p><p>Companies can choose whether to comply with the authorities or not, and some of them give the subject of a subpoena up to 14 days to fight it in court. Google told <em>The Times</em> that its review process for government requests is “ designed to protect user privacy while meeting [its] legal obligations” and that it informs users when their accounts have been subpoenaed unless it has been legally ordered not to or in exceptional circumstances. “We review every legal demand and push back against those that are overbroad,” the company said. </p><p>Some of the accounts that were subpoenaed belong to users posting ICE activity in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Facebook and Instagram in English and Spanish. The DHS asked Meta for their names and details on September 11, and the users were notified about it on October 3. They were told that if Meta didn’t receive documentation that they were fighting the subpoena in court within 10 days, Meta will give Homeland Security the information it was asking for. The ACLU filed a motion for the users in court, arguing that the DHS is using administrative subpoenas as a tool to suppress speech of people it didn’t agree with. </p><p>In late January, Meta started <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-blocks-links-to-ice-list-a-wiki-that-names-agents-231410653.html\" target=\"_blank\">blocking links to ICE List</a>, a website that lists thousands of ICE and Border Patrol agents’ names.

A whole bunch of compelling games arrived this week, and Sony dropped some news about more that are on the way to PS5 and other platforms during its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-watch-playstations-hour-long-state-of-play-and-what-to-expect-162128585.html\" target=\"_blank\">State of Play stream on Thursday</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>For one thing, I didn’t have a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-neva-prequel-is-arriving-next-week-081239628.html\" target=\"_blank\">prequel for <em>Neva</em></a>, one of my favorite games of the last few years on my bingo card. I’m very much looking forward to checking out that DLC next week.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>It’s really neat that Motion Twin and Evil Empire — the studios behind <em>Dead Cells</em> and its expansions, respectively — are getting to make a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dead-cells-castlevania-dlc-trailer-release-window-012349322.html\" target=\"_blank\">proper Castlevania game</a>. While it might not be developing many games in-house anymore, giving external studios the chance to run with its franchises is a very smart move on Konami’s part. Not least because we’re getting a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/silent-hill-townfall-takes-the-series-trademark-fog-to-an-eerie-coastal-community-233324897.html\" target=\"_blank\">Silent Hill game set in Scotland as well</a>.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>I’ve had<em> Big Walk</em> on my radar since the game was first shown off <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-walk-is-the-next-project-from-the-untitled-goose-game-team-014503842.html\" target=\"_blank\">at The Game Awards a couple of years back</a>. This is a co-op multiplayer game from <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> studio House House and publisher Panic in which you'll go on adventures with your friends and help each other through puzzles and other challenges using voice, text chat and gestures. You can just hang out with your buds and watch the sunset or put their binoculars into the ocean too.</p><p>Expect <em>Big Walk</em> to arrive later this year on PS5 (including as a Monthly Game for all PS Plus members), Steam and Epic Games Store. There will be support for cross-platform play between PS5 and PC.</p><p>Also, Remedy Entertainment is technically an indie studio. As such, I can mention here that I cannot wait for <em>Control Resonant</em>, which is probably going to break my brain with all the perspective shifting Remedy showed off in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-first-control-resonant-gameplay-trailer-shows-dylan-defying-physics-in-a-sideways-nyc-224746545.html\" target=\"_blank\">the gameplay trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-new-releases\">New releases</h2><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>As with any successful heist, planning and execution are equally paramount in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rescue-african-artifacts-from-colonizers-museums-in-the-heist-game-relooted-000035161.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Relooted</em></a>. Setting things up properly before hightailing it out of a museum with artifacts reminds me a bit of <em>Teardown</em> albeit without all the voxel destruction. But <em>Relooted</em> is a lot more than that.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an anti-colonialist story in which parkour enthusiast Nomali and her crew take back African artifacts (all of which exist in real life) from Western museums. I did encounter some performance issues while playing on PC, but that didn't take too much away from the enjoyable, in-the-moment action and having to adjust escape routes on the fly when things go awry. Nor did the framerate drops detract one bit from the important story that South African studio Nyamakop is telling here.</p><p><em>Relooted </em>is out now on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/relooted-89fdd7\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Store</a> and <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6ffef56b-cf61-4e51-b729-b51fe5f828a9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9yZWxvb3RlZC85cHBwNTM0NGIzbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZmZmVmNTZiLWNmNjEtNGU1MS1iNzI5LWI1MWZlNWY4MjhhOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvcmVsb290ZWQvOXBwcDUzNDRiM2xzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUVLf7VY__JniAzAb0NzQAwzjMV2IK4G3SSylF-wCMTp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Frelooted%2F9ppp5344b3ls\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Series X/S</a>.

It was initially announced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-16-latest-mew-genics-teaser-collects-trinkets-with-magic-propertie.html\" target=\"_blank\">in 2012</a> when co-developer Edmund McMillen was still part of <em>Super Meat Boy </em>studio Team Meat. After years of <em>Mewgenics </em>being in development hell amid McMillen focusing on projects such as <em>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</em>, he's finally seen the game through with the help of longtime collaborator Tyler Glaiel.</p><p>This is a turn-based strategy roguelike in which players breed cats and then take kitties with wild mutations and blends of powers into combat. There's a lot to explore and discover here. McMillen and Glaiel claim the main campaign runs for over 200 hours. Having more than 10&nbsp;character classes (each with 75 unique abilities), more than 900 items and hundreds of bosses and enemies could well ensure that things stay fresh enough to justify that run time.</p><p>Reviews have largely been positive for this one, though the humor didn't click for some critics. <em>Mewgenics </em>is out now on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>. It usually costs $30, but you can save $3 if you buy it by February 24.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>Rogue Point </em>is a co-op shooter for up to four players that’s worth paying attention to, in large part because it’s from the team behind <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-black-mesa-the-fan-made-half-life-remake-finally-has-a-rel.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Black Mesa</em></a>, the fan remake of <em>Half-Life</em>. It's now available in early access on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>, typically for $20, though there's a 15 percent discount until February 26.</p><p>This appears to be in the vein of tactical shooters like Ubisoft's Tom Clancy games. There are objective-based missions and a Counter-Strike-style economy for unlocking and upgrading gear. While there are only four maps as things stand, Crowbar Collective has implemented a system that randomizes the layouts to keep things fresh.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-upcoming\">Upcoming&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Steam Next Fest is almost upon us. Many developers and publishers are preparing to release demos for their games, but some are arriving ahead of the event, such as one for <em>Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!</em> The demo is a blast and it feels like the kind of retro <em>Starship Troopers</em> shooter I wish we'd had in the late '90s.&nbsp;</p><p>I really enjoy <em>Helldivers 2</em>, which takes a lot of inspiration from <em>Starship Troopers</em>. In turn, this game draws from <em>Helldivers 2</em>, with features like tossing a flare to tell a support craft to send gear down to the planet's surface. I just wish the mech was a bit more fun and effective to use.</p><p>If you would like to know more about this game from <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em> developer Auroch Digital and publisher Dotemu, you can check out the demo on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4307720/Starship_Troopers_Ultimate_Bug_War__Demo/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>. <em>Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War! </em>is coming to Steam, GOG, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 16.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>A demo for a line-based puzzle title called <em>Rope </em>popped up on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4329270/Rope_Demo/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> this week ahead of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3866170/Rope/\" target=\"_blank\">full game's arrival</a> in April for about $3.50. The aim is to connect ropes of the same color to clear them. More rules will be introduced over time to make the game more challenging.</p><p>While <em>Rope</em> looks charming enough, I mainly wanted to include it in this week’s roundup because I thought developer Ikuo's comments in the press release were quite lovely.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;My games are neither flashy nor extravagant. Instead, I focus on preserving the essence of play. Like hide‑and‑seek or tag — simple rules that draw you in until you forget the time,&quot; Ikuo said. &quot;<em>Rope </em>brings that timeless spirit of play into a modern puzzle game. It is intuitive, endlessly replayable and quietly absorbing. I aimed to create a small, understated experience that stays with players long after they put it down. I hope this game leaves even a small impression on someone’s heart.&quot;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>The Mermaid Mask </em>is a project that SFB Games put on the backburner after another one of their games became a hit (that would be <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/crow-country-is-a-darkly-meditative-callback-to-survival-horrors-past-130041405.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Crow Country</em></a>, which was one of our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-games-of-the-year-2024-133005519.html\" target=\"_blank\">favorite games of 2024</a>). </p><p>This point-and-click puzzle game is the latest installment in the long-running Detective Grimoire series<em>.&nbsp;</em>A teaser trailer doesn't give away too much, but I do enjoy what we see of the hand-drawn 2D animation here. </p><p>Here's hoping this is a worthy follow-up to <em>Tangle Tower</em>, an Apple Arcade game <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-apple-arcade-best-games.html\" target=\"_blank\">we enjoyed very much</a>. We'll find out for sure when <em>The Mermaid Mask </em>lands on PC and consoles this summer. In the meantime, you can check out an updated demo that just hit <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1696770/The_Mermaid_Mask/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> ahead of Next Fest.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>The premise of<em> The Stairwell</em> is practically identical to that of <em>The Exit 8</em>. You walk through a small, contained scene multiple times. If everything looks okay, keep walking forward. If something is out of the ordinary, you turn around. Just try not to miss many anomalies. Rather than walk through corridors as in <em>The Exit 8</em> (the film adaptation of which <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlRQ1oatOt8\" target=\"_blank\">looks pretty promising</a>), <em>The Stairwell</em> sees you going up or down a seemingly infinite tower as you try to reach the goal.&nbsp;</p><p>This anomaly game, which is from Hidden Palace, has been on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3578120/The_Stairwell/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> since last year. It’s coming to PS5 on February 19. Expect jump scares.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Let's wrap things up for this week with an arcade game that requires just two inputs: one button to turn left, and another to veer right. You can't control the speed of your craft in <em>Ship v Maze</em>. All you can do to avoid crashing and ending your run is to react quickly enough to steer your ship through various obstacles. It's all about putting your reflexes to the test.</p><p><em>Ship v Maze </em>is from Cosmic Droplet (aka solo developer Frederic Vanmol), It'll hit <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113380/Ship_v_Maze/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> on April 2 for $4. A demo is available now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/relooted-reanimal-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000234.html?src=rss",
