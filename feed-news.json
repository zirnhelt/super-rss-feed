On Wednesday, Google posted a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIkj4yz2t_E\">teaser video</a> showing the mid-range phone dancing around colorful backgrounds. You can pre-order the Pixel 10a on February 18.</p> \n<p>Google hasn't yet revealed the phone's specs. In the short video, we can see a blue model that's virtually indistinguishable on the outside from the Pixel 9a. And <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.droid-life.com/2025/12/10/pixel-10a-specs-verizon-certification/\">alleged leaks</a> point to a phone with few changes on the inside.

Much of the art that filters down to us from ancient civilizations was used for official purposes (state, religion, commerce); it&#8217;s nice to see something simpler like this drawing. <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/alisonfisk.bsky.social/post/3mdx7dugqzs2u\">Archaeologist Alison Fisk</a>:\n\n<blockquote><p>This may have been a practice drawing of the sparrow hieroglyph which was used for words meaning &#8216;small&#8217;, &#8216;poor&#8217;, or &#8216;bad&#8217;</p>\n\n<p>The Egyptian artisans who decorated tombs and temples, drew sketches and jotted down notes on the plentiful limestone flakes which were by-products of temple and rock-cut tomb construction. Egyptologists refer to them as &#8216;ostraca&#8217; (singular: ostracon). More info: <a href=\"https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/ostracon/\">ancientegyptonline.co.uk/ostracon/</a></p></blockquote>\n\nFrom <a href=\"https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/ostracon/\">that link</a> about ostracon:\n\n<blockquote><p>The word &#8220;ostracon&#8221; is derived from the Greek &#8220;ostrakon&#8221; (meaning a piece of pottery used as a voting ballot). When a vote was held on whether to banish a person from society these shards were used to cast votes. This is the origin of the word &#8220;ostracism&#8221; (literally meaning &#8220;to be voted out&#8221;).</p></blockquote> \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Alison%20Fisk\">Alison Fisk</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/archaeology\">archaeology</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Egypt\">Egypt</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/language\">language</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Met%20Museum\">Met Museum</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/museums\">museums</a></p>\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/02/a-lovely-3500-year-old-drawing-of-a-sparrow\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>",

Multiple sources claim that Apple could be targeting a late-2026 launch for its first foldable phone, and new rumors suggest the company is even already thinking about its second model, which could be a clamshell-style foldable iPhone.</p><p>But of course, nothing is official yet. Plans can change, features can be dropped and timelines can slip. Still, recent reports paint the clearest picture yet of how Apple might approach a foldable iPhone and how it plans to differentiate itself from rivals like Samsung and Google.</p><p>Here, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering its possible release timing, design, display technology, cameras and price. We’ll continue to update this post as more rumors and details become available.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-could-the-iphone-fold-launch\">When could the iPhone Fold launch?</h2><p>Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://theorg.com/org/bloomberg/org-chart/mark-gurman\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Gurman</a> has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-11/apple-2027-plans-tabletop-robot-20th-anniversary-iphone-ios-19-wi-fi-feature\" target=\"_blank\">ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027</a>. Analyst <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\" target=\"_blank\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.</p><p>Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-iphone-fold-look-like\">What will the iPhone Fold look like?</h2><p>Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.</p><p>When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3030017/a-case-maker-might-have-leaked-the-iphone-fold-design.html\" target=\"_blank\">CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds</a> suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-hands-on-the-super-sleek-precursor-to-apples-upcoming-foldable-185851102.html\" target=\"_blank\"> iPhone Air as a potential preview</a> of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.</p><p>If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.</p><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a476c2e0-9780-11f0-bd4b-d87caa240702\" style=\"height: 1263px; width: 2400px;\" /><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><h2 id=\"jump-link-display-and-the-crease-question\">Display and the crease question</h2><p>The display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.</p><p>Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-crease-less-foldable-oled-panel-showcased-z-fold-8/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel</a>, which several sources — including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a> — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.</p><p>According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.</p><p>If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-cameras-and-biometrics\">Cameras and biometrics</h2><p>Camera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:</p><ul><li><p>Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)</p></li><li><p>One punch-hole camera on the outer display</p></li><li><p>One under-display camera on the inner screen</p></li></ul><p>Several sources claim <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple will avoid Face ID</a> entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-will-reportedly-bring-back-touch-id-on-a-foldable-iphone-135831748.html\" target=\"_blank\">rely on Touch ID</a> built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.</p><p>Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://wccftech.com/apples-first-foldable-iphone-to-have-a-24-megapixel-under-display-selfie-camera-no-faceid/\" target=\"_blank\">rumored 24MP sensor</a> would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-iphone-folds-hinge-and-materials\">iPhone Fold’s hinge and materials</h2><p>The hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/14/iphone-folds-titanium-liquid-metal-rumors-just-wont-go-away\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple reports claim Apple will use </a>Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.</p><p>Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/youtuber-jon-prosser-posts-foldable-iphone-renders\" target=\"_blank\">Leaks from Jon Prosser</a> also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-battery-and-other-components\">Battery and other components&nbsp;</h2><p>Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=224077504572&amp;navType=by\" target=\"_blank\">multiple Asian supply-chain reports</a>, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.</p><p>That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-price\">Price</h2><p>None of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone</a> ever.</p><p>Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,”</a> while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.</p><p>Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-foldable-design-130000349.html?src=rss",

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion.

Based on Bond’s statement back then, Microsoft is embracing the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in future Xbox games. She also said that the companies are going to “co-engineer silicon” across devices, “in your living room and in your hands,” implying the development of future <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/we-might-not-be-getting-that-handheld-xbox-for-some-time-153844220.html\" target=\"_blank\">handheld</a> consoles. </p><p>Leaked documents from the FTC vs. Microsoft court battle <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/leaked-microsoft-documents-detail-cloud-hybrid-next-gen-xbox-for-2028-110309102.html\" target=\"_blank\">revealed</a> in the past that Microsoft was planning to make the next Xbox a “hybrid game platform,” which combines local hardware and cloud computing.

The Switch 2 port was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/switch-2-owners-can-play-borderlands-4-on-october-3-200651283.html\" target=\"_blank\">originally planned to be released</a> on October 3, 2025, a few weeks after the game's September 12 launch on all other platforms, but was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">indefinitely delayed</a> on September 23.</p><p>&quot;We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU,&quot; <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/\" target=\"_blank\">Take-Two told <em>Variety</em></a>. &quot;Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. We’re continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have <em>PGA Tour 2K25</em> coming out and <em>WWE 2K26</em>, and we're incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future.&quot;</p><p>When the <em>Borderlands 4</em> Switch 2 port was originally delayed, the game's developer Gearbox shared that the port needed &quot;additional development and polish time&quot; and that it hoped to &quot;better align this release with the addition of cross saves.&quot; In Take-Two's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/2b782ec8-e583-4f7b-a213-86f2d1dbce40\" target=\"_blank\">Q2 earnings presentation</a> on November 6, 2025, the Switch 2 port was still listed as having a &quot;TBA&quot; release date. The lack of mention in the company's Q3 presentation and Take-Two's comment to <em>Variety</em> pretty much confirm that if a Switch 2 version happens, it won't be anytime soon. The official <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/2026-roadmap/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Borderlands 4</em> post-release content roadmap</a> currently lists plans for paid and free story DLC and raid bosses, but nothing related to additional ports of the game.</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>'s planned <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-november-19-2026-211848530.html\" target=\"_blank\">November 19 release date</a> is still on the books, however. Rockstar Games' next blockbuster title was originally<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-6-will-arrive-in-fall-2025-205513138.html\" target=\"_blank\"> supposed to be released in fall 2025</a>, before it was delayed to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-delayed-to-may-2026-120405517.html\" target=\"_blank\">May 2026</a> last May. The game was delayed a second and final time — at least for now — in November 2025, to its current November 2026 release date. </p><p>There's still room for another delay, but in the earnings statement Take-Two projected confidence, sharing that Rockstar would start marketing the game this summer. The franchise remains a cash cow, so it’s only natural the company would want to get the rollout of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> right. As part of its earnings presentation, Take-Two shared that <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>, which was originally released all the way back in 2013, has sold 225 million units.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/take-two-hit-pause-on-the-switch-2-port-of-borderlands-4-222546776.html?src=rss",

Disney <a href=\"https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/news/disney-ceo-announcement/\">has announced</a> a successor to outgoing CEO Bob Iger, effective in March. Josh D’Amaro, current chairman of Disney Experiences, was tapped for the role in a unanimous vote by the company's board of directors.</p>\n<p>D’Amaro has been at Disney for 28 years, where he oversaw theme parks, cruises and consumer products including video games. The company had <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-disney-ceo-replacement.html\"><ins>previously appointed</ins></a> Bob Chapek, the Disney Parks chairman at the time, as successor to Bob Iger in 2020. At the time, Iger had served as CEO since 2005. But Chapek only lasted until 2022, when Bob Iger <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bob-iger-is-returning-as-disney-ceo-in-a-huge-shakeup-065239929.html\"><ins>returned</ins></a> to take the helm once again amid company struggles. Disney formed a committee to find an appropriate successor in 2023, with Iger mentoring potential candidates along the way.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Iger's time at the helm saw the media giant make a number of significant moves such as launching the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-disney-plus-launch.html\"><ins>Disney+</ins></a> streaming service, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/disney-to-buy-out-comcast-and-take-full-control-of-hulu-054157026.html\"><ins>buying Hulu</ins></a> and acquiring 20th Century Fox's film and television studios.

It costs $600. The company says this is the \"world's slimmest vacuum cleaner.\" We haven't broken out any rulers to confirm that statement, but it's certainly a ridiculously thin stick vac.</p>\n<p>It achieves this thinness by using a motor inspired by the company's</p>\n<p>. This is a small motor that can actually rest in the shaft, so there's not a noticeable bulge where the components have been placed. This stick vacuum is actually, well, a stick. Just take a look at it.</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"A vacuum being emptied.\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/ce123cb0-fd2e-11f0-96ff-0adad0972d61\" style=\"height: 1154px; width: 1240px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  A vacuum being emptied.\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Dyson\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>It does come with attachments that increase the size a bit. For instance, the conical brush bar cleaner head makes it resemble a traditional stick vacuum. However, everything else is in the long cylinder. This includes the bin, filter and motor.</p>\n<p>Other attachments include something called the \"Fluffycones\" cleaner head. This has four cones in two brush bars that rotate in opposite directions to \"strip and eject even long hair, preventing hair tangling around the brush bar.\" There are also lights at both ends to help illuminate any lingering dust particles.</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"A cleaning head.\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/17d0b750-fd2f-11f0-a7ef-5d9bfb26bd5f\" style=\"height: 1154px; width: 1654px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  A cleaning head.\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Dyson\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>It weighs nearly four pounds and features the same diameter throughout. This makes it easy to grip anywhere along the body, which can help with overhead cleaning. It ships with a swappable battery pack that lasts for around an hour and there's a magnetic charging dock to get things juiced up.</p>\n<p>The vacuum works with the MyDyson app, which lets users check on battery life and adjust settings. Some of this information is also displayed on the LCD screen at the top of the handle.</p>\n<p>We got a chance to try it out last year and came away impressed. The motor is plenty powerful, despite the diminished size, and the device was easy to maneuver. If you have $600 to spare and a dirty home, this could be a good purchase.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/the-dyson-pencilvac-is-finally-available-and-costs-600-160059016.html?src=rss",

(<a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-the-same-picture\">They&#8217;re the same picture</a>.)\n\nMorello spoke briefly before the performance:\n\n<blockquote><p>Brothers and sisters, thank you for welcoming us to the Battle of Minneapolis. My friends, if it looks like fascism, sounds like fascism, acts like fascism, dresses like fascism, talks like fascism, kills like fascism and lies like fascism, brothers and sisters, it&#8217;s fucking fascism. It&#8217;s here, it&#8217;s now, it&#8217;s in my city, it&#8217;s in your city and it must be resisted, protested, defended against, stood up to, exposed, ousted, overthrown and driven out. By who? By you. By me.</p>\n\n<p>Minneapolis is an inspiration to the entire nation. You have heroically stood up against ICE, stood up against Trump, stood up against this terrible rising tide of state terror. You&#8217;ve stood up for your neighbors and for yourselves and for democracy and for justice. Ain&#8217;t nobody coming to save us, except us. And brothers and sisters, you are showing the way.</p>\n\n<p>To that end, we would like to begin our program with an old Native American war chant. We encourage you to singalong, in this very room Prince created a revolution, now it&#8217;s our turn.</p></blockquote>\n\nHere&#8217;s the official video for Killing In The Name:\n\n\n\nPS.
