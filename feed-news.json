But it's still a phone, arguably your most used device on a daily basis, so you may need to top it up during the day if you're using it constantly.

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

But while Ford's high-rising, hard-sided \"winterproof\" Nugget is available to order with buyer's choice of rear toilet or extended cabinetry, it's not available with all-wheel drive. Feeling this a rather large market gap, aftermarket conversion shop Nugget Schmiede has introduced its own sleek high sleeper roof atop a factory long-wheelbase Nugget with all-wheel drive.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/ford-nugget-high-roof-awd-camper/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/\">Campervans</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/adventure-vehicles/\">Adventure Vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/outdoors/\">Outdoors</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/ford/\" rel=\"tag\">Ford</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/campervan/\" rel=\"tag\">Campervan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/mini-campervan/\" rel=\"tag\">mini-campervan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/\" rel=\"tag\">Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/\" rel=\"tag\">RV</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/\" rel=\"tag\">Outdoors and Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/off-road/\" rel=\"tag\">Off-road</a></p>",

Complaints about the NLRB's independence and power are not uncommon. Amazon has <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-one-of-the-worlds-largest-employers-has-called-the-national-labor-relations-board-unconstitutional-011519013.html\" target=\"_blank\">previously claimed</a> that the board's structure &quot;violates the separation of powers,&quot; a critique the company has made <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/amazon-wants-the-consumer-product-safety-commission-deemed-unconstitutional-211037804.html\" target=\"_blank\">even more recently</a> about the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The NLRB dismissed its SpaceX case following an even more unusual line of argument, though: that regulating SpaceX actually fell under the jurisdiction of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://nmb.gov/NMB_Application/\" target=\"_blank\">National Mediation Board</a>, the government agency that handles mediation in the airline and railway industries.</p><p>Because the company will technically let anyone book a space flight with it, and it operates under a license from the Federal Aviation Administration, SpaceX's lawyers argue it should be treated like an airline. According to <em>The New York Times</em>, the National Mediation Board issued a decision affirming that logic in January, and not long after, the NLRB dismissed its SpaceX case using the same line of thinking.</p><p>Elon Musk and his companies maintain a close relationship with the Trump administration. Musk spent <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/musk-says-he-will-cut-back-on-political-spending-after-paying-at-least-250m-backing-trump-in-2024\" target=\"_blank\">over $250 million</a> to help re-elect President Donald Trump, and he briefly served as a special government employee overseeing budget cuts and layoffs <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://abcnews.com/Politics/elon-musks-government-dismantling-fight-stop/story?id=118576033\" target=\"_blank\">across various government bodies</a> as part of the Department of Government Efficiency. The NLRB gave up its own authority to regulate, rather than it being stripped of funding or employees, but the decision still fits a larger pattern of independent agencies being disempowered during the second Trump administration.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-nlrb-just-gave-up-on-spacex-workers-who-claim-they-were-illegally-fired-215332847.html?src=rss",

Itch.io is <a href=\"https://itch.io/b/3484/no-ice-in-minnesota\"><ins>hosting a bundle</ins></a> to help raise money for the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, which was organized by <a href=\"https://jesthehuman.itch.io/\"><ins>charity creator Jes Wade</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>The No ICE in Minnesota bundle includes nearly 1,300 video games and tabletop games and costs just $10, though those with deep pockets can certainly donate more than that. It has a goal of $100,000, which it certainly is on pace to meet.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"2730c278d2954cbcb622186f3adee446\"></div>\n<p>There are some nifty titles here, particularly for those interested in indie puzzle games and life sims. The standout is likely the stellar puzzler <em>Baba Is You</em>, which won the Game Designers Award at the <a href=\"http://cancelled/\"><ins>Tokyo Games Show in 2020</ins></a>. This is a game that has to be played to be understood, as players are given the opportunity to change the rules to find novel solutions to complex puzzles. It's very good.</p>\n<p>The bundle includes the life simulation game <em>Calico</em>, which involves players running a cat cafe on a magical island. The art style is gorgeous and the gameplay is relaxing. Also, calico cats are awesome.</p>\n<p>Other titles include the bee-collecting sim <em>Apico</em>, the musical sci-fi adventure <em>Periphery Synthetic</em> and the space-based roguelike <em>Hyperspace Dogfights</em>. Scroll through the list to see if anything else strikes your interest, but mark out some time on the calendar first. Scrolling through nearly 1,300 games can take a while.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.ilcm.org/\"><ins>Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota</ins></a> is a nonprofit that provides free representation to low-income immigrants and refugees. The organization also provides support for those who have witnessed violent attacks and advocates for public policies which &quot;respect the universal human rights of immigrants.&quot;</p>\n<div id=\"bc3378474203451793d1a86b8958ae1c\"></div>\n<p>I live in Minneapolis. ICE is still here in full force, despite the media moving on to shinier objects. We really do need all the help we can get. The long-term presence of these masked, armed agents <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/10/minnesota-small-business-ice-immigration-agents\"><ins>is really starting to destroy the local economy</ins></a> and many people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/feb/09/minnesota-ice-immigration-deportation-raids\"><ins>quite literally trapped indoors</ins></a>. To say morale is low would be an understatement. Schools <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v91zqf-PHqI\"><ins>are still being raided</ins></a> and people are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAQT4XWOXZY\"><ins>still being brutally beaten</ins></a>. American citizens <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46irH9yE3dM\"><ins>are still being arrested for dubious reasons</ins></a>. This is all happening after the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti.</p>\n<p>That's why these fundraising bundles on Itch have become so important. They really do shine a light on important topics. This is organizer Jes Wade's second ICE-related bundle, with a former focusing on California relief efforts.

The Next 2 is powered by an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and has a massive 115Mh battery under the hood.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To put all of that into perspective, the Next 2’s display is more than 1.5 inches larger than the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-oled-review-its-just-better-180038030.html\">Steam Deck OLED’s</a>, and goes bigger than even the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-legion-go-2-review-the-utility-pc-gaming-handheld-120000533.html\">Lenovo Legion Go 2</a>’s 8.8-inch panel. Its battery is the largest of the three by some margin too, and according to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/just-look-at-ayaneos-absolute-unit-of-a-windows-gaming-handheld/\"><em>Ars Technica</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>it weighs in at around 3.14 pounds (around 1424g), making it more than twice as heavy as the very heavy <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review-an-extra-life-for-xbox-130050224.html\">Xbox ROG Ally X</a>. Get those wrists to the gym if you’re considering picking one of these up.</p>\n<p>Ayaneo is ticking all the boxes where inputs are concerned too. Its latest handheld has dual touchpads (a feature ASUS left out on the ROG Xbox Ally X), Hall Effect sticks, an 8-way D-Pad and four customizable rear buttons.</p>\n<p>All of this tech inevitably comes at a high price, with the entry-level model that ships with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage coming in at $1,999, or $1,799 if you take advantage of early bird pricing. This model is equipped with the slightly less capable Ryzen AI Max 385 CPU.</p>\n<p>If you want the more powerful AI+ 395 chip you have a few options. A variant of the Next II with 64GB of RAM and 1TB of storage costs $2,699, but you can order now at the early bird price of $2,299. For 128GB of RAM and 2TB of storage you’ll be handing over a slightly hilarious $4,299 at full price. Early birds can order now for $3,499.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-ayaneo-next-2-is-a-massive-pc-handheld-with-a-price-tag-to-match-165326534.html?src=rss",

It's not the first time <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-extended-battery-airtag-case-is-down-to-only-16-162308748.html\">we've seen this deal</a>, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This is arguably one of the more useful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\"><ins>AirTag accessories</ins></a> around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> \n<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> \n<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-10-year-extended-battery-case-for-airtag-is-back-on-sale-for-16-151215952.html?src=rss",

That's $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> \n<p>We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/disney-and-hulu-deal-get-one-month-of-the-bundle-for-10-192814395.html?src=rss",

It successfully blocks background noise at medium and high frequencies, including the human voice.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction.</p> \n<p>The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The only real major nitpick here is the original asking price.

From controller grips that offer better handling to upgraded head straps that balance weight and extend battery life, these add-ons can make long sessions more enjoyable and less fatiguing. Some accessories focus on convenience, like charging docks and storage stands, while others enhance how virtual experiences feel through haptic feedback or more secure fits.<br /><br />As VR continues to expand beyond gaming into fitness, productivity and mixed reality experiences, accessories are starting to serve a wider range of functions. Whether you’re looking to fine-tune comfort, improve tracking or add realism to your virtual world, these are the VR accessories worth considering in 2026.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-vr-accessories-controllers\">Best VR accessories: Controllers</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-vr-accessories-headsets\">Best VR accessories: Headsets</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-vr-accessories-fitness\">Best VR accessories: Fitness</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-vr-accessories-cables-chargers-and-batteries\">Best VR accessories: Cables, chargers and batteries</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p></p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-vr-accessories-faqs\">VR accessories FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-equipment-do-you-need-for-vr\">What equipment do you need for VR?</h3> \n<p>What you need depends on the VR headset you buy. Some devices, like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-vr-150009788.html\">Meta Quest 3</a>, are entirely standalone, which means you don't need anything but the headset itself to use it. Other VR headsets need to be connected to a system from which it can draw power and run software. Some systems, like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/hp-reverb-g2-review-vr-windows-mixed-reality-130012057.html\">HP Reverb G2</a>, must connect to a PC, while others like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr2-review-great-headset-should-be-cheaper-130032254.html\">PS VR2</a> can connect to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-console-140057674.html\">gaming consoles</a> like the PS5.

PC VR headsets require a PC, like a gaming laptop or desktop, to run, while smartphone and gaming console VR systems require smartphones and gaming consoles, respectively, to work.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-do-all-vr-headsets-need-a-phone\">Do all VR headsets need a phone?</h3> \n<p>No, not all VR headsets need a phone to work. Many VR headsets have build in displays that sit in front of your eyes and basically act as your window into the virtual world.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/best-vr-accessories-150021126.html?src=rss",
