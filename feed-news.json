She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.&quot;</p><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 365px;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I’m excited for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asha_shar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@asha_shar</a> as she steps into the CEO role.

Watching her lean in with curiosity and a real desire to strengthen the foundation we've built gives me confidence that our Xbox communities will be well supported in the years ahead.”</p><p>Alongside Sharma, Matt Booty, the current head of Xbox Game Studios, is getting promoted to Chief Content Officer, and will report to Sharma. Sarah Bond, who like Spencer served as a public face for the Xbox brand and was assumed to be his successor, is leaving Microsoft to &quot;begin a new chapter.&quot; Bond has yet to make a public statement about her resignation.</p><p>Spencer joined Microsoft in 1988, and has worked on Xbox since at least 2001. He assumed responsibility for Microsoft's gaming brand and its various studios and associated subscription products in 2013, before becoming an Executive VP of Gaming in 2017 and later CEO of Microsoft Gaming in 2022. Spencer's biggest impact on Xbox will likely be remembered as the creation of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-24-xbox-game-pass-launch-date-100-games-june-1st.html\" target=\"_blank\">Game Pass</a>, Microsoft's &quot;Netflix for Games&quot; and the wave of studio acquisitions Microsoft completed from 2018 to 2022, which included smaller studios like <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-09-double-fine-joins-microsoft-studios.html\" target=\"_blank\">Double Fine</a> and the massive<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-now-officially-belongs-to-microsoft-125053787.html\" target=\"_blank\"> $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard King</a>.</p><p>While Microsoft has plenty of developers and IP to fall back on, it's struggled to compete with the likes of Sony and Nintendo during the current console generation. Microsoft's gaming division has gone through <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html\" target=\"_blank\">widespread layoffs</a>, its revenue <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-console-revenue-fell-30-percent-year-over-year-this-summer-012245146.html\" target=\"_blank\">continued to fall</a> throughout 2025 and it raised the prices of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html\" target=\"_blank\">both its consoles</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html\" target=\"_blank\">Game Pass Ultimate</a>, which likely won't help things going forward. Sharma is in many ways inheriting <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/2025-was-the-year-xbox-died-130000467.html\" target=\"_blank\">a broken-down car</a>.</p><p>As far as her plans go, Sharma’s email to staff that was included in Nadella's announcement is light on details. Sharma says she plans to continue developing &quot;great games,&quot; wants to &quot;recommit&quot; to core Xbox fans and &quot;invent new business models and new ways to play.&quot; Whether that’s enough to turn Xbox's fortunes around remains to be seen.<br /><br /><strong>Update, February 20, 4:52PM ET:</strong> Added statement from Phil Spencer shared on X.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-head-phil-spencer-is-leaving-microsoft-212838419.html?src=rss",

Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Social media turned US parties into host organisms for third parties; \"Citizens\" are hired actors; Insured exoskeletons; Talking with Snowden and Gibson. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A perforated corporate veil (permalink) \"Capitalist realism\" is the idea that the world's current economic and political arrangements are inevitable, and that any attempt to alter them is a) irrational; b) doomed; and c) dangerous. It's the ideology of Margaret Thatcher's maxim, \"There is no alternative.\" Obviously this is very convenient if you are a current beneficiary of the status quo. \"There is no alternative\" is a thought-stopping demand dressed up as an observation. It means, \"Don't try and think of alternatives.\" The thing is, alternatives already exist and work very well. The Mondragon co-ops in Spain constitute a fully worked out, long-term stable economic alternative to traditional capitalist enterprises, employing more than 100,000 people and generating tangible, empirically measured benefits to workers, customers and the region: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation Proponents of capitalist realism will tell you that Mondragon doesn't count. Maybe it's just a one-off. Or maybe it's just not big enough. 100,000 workers sounds like a lot, but Amazon has over 1.5m employees and untold numbers of misclassified contractors who are employees in everything but name (and legal rights). This is some pretty transparent goalpost moving, but sure, let's stipulate that Mondragon doesn't prove that there are broadly applicable alternatives to the dominant capitalism of the mid-2020s. Are there other examples of \"an alternative?\" There sure are. Let's look at limited liability. Limited liability &#8211; the idea that a company's shareholders cannot be held liable for the company's misdeeds &#8211; is a bedrock of capitalist dogma. The story goes that until the advent of the \"joint stock enterprise\" (and its handmaiden, limited liability) there was no efficient way to do \"capital formation\" (raising money for a project or business). Because of this, the only ambitious, capital-intensive projects were those that caught the fancy of a king, a Pope, or an aristocrat. But once limited liability appears on the scene, many people of modest means can jointly invest in a project without worrying about being bankrupted if it turns out that the people running it are crooks or bumblers. That lets you, say, buy a single share of a company without having to keep daily tabs on the management's every action without worrying that if they go wrong, someone they've hurt will sue you for everything you've got. Capital formation is a real thing, and limited liability unquestionably facilitates capital formation. There are plenty of good things in the world that exist because limited liability protections allowed everyday people to help bring them into existence. This isn't just stuff that makes a lot of money for capitalism's true believers, it includes everything from the company that makes the printing presses that your favorite anarchist zine runs on to the mill that makes the alloys for the e-bike you use to get to a demonstration. This is where capitalist realism comes in. Capitalist realists will claim that there is no way to do capital formation for these beneficial goods without limited liability &#8211; and not just any limited liability, but maximum limited liability in which the \"corporate veil\" can never be pierced to assign culpability to any shareholder. The capitalist realist claim is that the corporate veil is like the skin of a balloon, and that any attempt to poke even the smallest hole in it will cause it to rupture and vanish. But this just isn't true, and we can tell, because one of the largest economies in the world has operated with a perforated corporate veil for nearly a century, and that economy hasn't suffered from capital formation problems. Quite the contrary, some of the world's largest (and most destructive) monopolies are headquartered in this country where the veil of limited liability is thoroughly perforated. The country I'm talking about is Brazil, which has had limited limited liability since 1937: https://lpeproject.org/blog/when-workers-pierce-the-corporate-veil-brazils-forgotten-innovation/ As Mariana Pargendler writes for the LPE Project, Brazil put limits on limited liability to address a common pattern of corporate abuse. Companies would set up in Brazil, incur a lot of liabilities (say, by poisoning the land, water and air, or by stealing from or maiming workers), and then, when the wheels of justice caught up with them, the companies would fold and re-establish themselves the next day under a new name. Like I say, this happens all over the world. It's incredibly common, and even the pettiest of crooks know how to use this trick. I know someone whose NYC apartment was flooded by the upstairs neighbor, who decided that they didn't need to worry about the fact that their toilet wouldn't stop running &#8211; for months, until the walls of the apartment downstairs dissolved in a slurry of black mold. The upstairs neighbor owned the apartment through an LLC, which they simply folded up and walked away from, while my friend was stuck with a giant bill and no one to sue. The limited liability company is the scammer's best friend. In the UK, an anti-tax extremist invented a tax-evasion scam whereby landlords pretend that their empty commercial buildings are tax-exempt \"snail farms\" by scattering around some boxes with a few snails in them: https://www.patreon.com/posts/149255928?collection=1941093 When this results in inevitable stonking fines and adverse judgments, the \"snail farmers\" duck liability by folding up their limited liability company after transferring its assets to a new LLC. Capitalist realists will tell you that this is just the price of efficient capital formation. Without total, airtight limited liability &#8211; the sort that allows for this kind of obvious, petty ripoff &#8211; no one would be able to raise capital for anything. Brazil begs to differ. In 1937, Brazil made parent companies liable for their subsidiaries' obligations, with a system of \"joint and several liability\" for LLCs. This was expanded with 1943's Consolidation of Labor Laws, and it worked so well that the Brazilian legislature expanded it again in 2017. Remember back in 2024, when Elon Musk defied a Brazilian court order about Twitter, only to have Brazil freeze Starlink's assets until Musk caved? That was the \"joint and several\" liability system: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/americas/brazil-musk-x-starlink.html As Pargendler writes, Brazil's liability system \"represented a distributive choice: prioritizing Brazilian workers’ ability to enforce their rights over foreign capital’s interest in minimizing costs through corporate structuring.\" Pargendler (who teaches at Harvard Law) co-authored a paper with São Paulo Law's Olívia Pasqualeto analyzing the impact that Brazil's limited liability system had on capital formation and corporate conduct: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6105586 Unsurprisingly, they find that there has been a steady pressure to erode the joint and several system, but also that some countries (the US and France) have a \"joint employer\" doctrine that is a weak form of this. Portugal, meanwhile, adopted the Brazilian system, 70 years after Brazil &#8211; this transposition of law from a former colony to a former colonial power is apparently called \"reverse convergence\": https://lpeproject.org/blog/heterodox-corporate-laws-in-the-global-south/ More countries in the global south have adopted regimes similar to Brazil's, like Venezuela and Chile. Other countries go further, like Mozambique and Angola. Somewhere in between are other Latin American countries like Peru and Uruguay, where these rules have entered practice through judicial rulings, not legislation. The authors don't claim that perforating the corporate veil solves all the problems of exploitative, fraudulent or corrupt corporate conduct. Rather, they're challenging the capitalist realist doctrine that insists that this system couldn't possibly exist, and if it did, it would be a disaster. A hundred years of Brazilian law, and Brazil's globe-spanning corporate giants, beg to differ. (Image: Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0, modified) Hey look at this (permalink) Rep.

It was supposed to be launched at Munich Security Conference last month, but some state department officials reportedly voiced their concerns about the project. The portal will be hosted on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://freedom.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">freedom.gov</a>, which currently just shows the image above. “Freedom is Coming,” the homepage reads. “Information is power. Reclaim your human right to free expression. Get Ready.”</p><p><em>Reuters</em> says officials discussed making a virtual private network function available on the portal and making visitors’ traffic appear as if they were from the US, so they could see anything unavailable to them. While it’s a state department project, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/19/us-builds-website-that-will-allow-europeans-to-view-blocked-content\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Guardian</em></a> has traced the domain to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is a component of the US Department of Homeland Security. Homeland also serves as the administrator for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). </p><p>The project could drive the wedge further between the US and its European allies. European authorities don’t usually order broad censorships preventing their citizens from being able to access large parts of the internet. Typically, they only order the blocking of hate speech, terrorist propaganda, disinformation and anything illegal under the EU’s Digital Services Act or the UK’s Online Safety Act. </p><p>“If the Trump administration is alleging that they’re gonna be bypassing content bans, what they’re gonna be helping users access in Europe is essentially hate speech, pornography, and child sexual abuse material,” Nina Jankowicz, who served as the executive director of Homeland Security’s Disinformation Governance Board, told <em>The Guardian</em>. The board was very short-lived and was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-national-security-83c67505703c02b0de154b21abd5c569\" target=\"_blank\">disbanded</a> a few months after it was formed, following complaints by Republican lawmakers that it would impinge on people’s rights to free speech. </p><p>When asked about the project, the state department said it didn’t have a program specifically meant to circumvent censorship in Europe. But the spokesperson said: “Digital freedom is a priority for the State Department, however, and that includes the proliferation of privacy and censorship-circumvention technologies like VPNs.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us-website-freedomgov-will-allow-europeans-to-view-hate-speech-and-other-blocked-content-130000014.html?src=rss",

It also said the platform failed to disclose any danger to children, including sexual content and the risk of predators.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Roblox rejected the allegations, saying the platform was built around safety. &quot;We have advanced safeguards that monitor our platform for harmful content and communications, and users cannot send or receive images via chat, avoiding one of the most prevalent opportunities for misuse seen elsewhere online,&quot; the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/feb/20/los-angeles-sues-roblox-la-county\">told the <em>AFP</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The LA county complaint is the latest in a string of lawsuits from US regions including Florida, Texas and Kentucky.

However, it has faced repeated <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\">accusations</a> that it doesn't do enough to protect young players. In 2024, Roblox banned players under 13 from accessing some types of in-game content and restricted their ability to message with other players outside of specific games. Last year, the company also began asking tens of millions of children to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-begins-asking-tens-of-millions-of-children-to-verify-their-age-with-a-selfie-120000311.html\">verify their age</a> with a selfie.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/la-county-lawsuit-accuses-roblox-of-exposing-children-to-grooming-and-exploitation-124523028.html?src=rss",

Each platform leans into something different, from original shows and blockbuster films to comfort rewatches and niche libraries, and not all of them earn a permanent spot in your monthly budget.<br /><br />This guide focuses on the on-demand streaming services that are the most worthwhile to live with day to day. Whether you’re lining up a few episodes after work, sharing an account with family or just want a reliable place to find something worth watching, these are the streaming services that consistently deliver the best mix of content, value and usability right now.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-streaming-services-for-2026\">Best streaming services for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html?src=rss",

The best budget models strike a great balance between price and performance, giving you smooth everyday use without cutting too many corners. Whether you’re scrolling social media, streaming your favorite shows or snapping photos of a night out, there’s an affordable Android phone that can handle it all.<br /><br />Cheaper phones have come a long way in recent years. Many now feature bright, fast displays, reliable cameras and battery life that lasts well into the next day. You might miss out on top-tier extras like the latest processor or ultra-high-resolution zoom, but what you get instead is value that makes sense. Some models even surprise with cameras that rival far pricier flagships, making them ideal for casual photographers or anyone who just wants to capture a great shot on the go.<br /><br />We’ve tested budget Android phones from brands like Google, Samsung and OnePlus to find the ones that deliver the most for less. These are the models that prove you don’t need a flagship price tag to get a dependable Android phone.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-budget-android-phones-for-2026\">Best budget Android phones for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-cheap-should-you-go-for-an-android-phone\">How cheap should you go for an Android phone?</h2> \n<p>We tend to define a budget smartphone as costing between $150 and $350. Any lower and the device runs the risk of suffering from too many compromises in function, and above that, you cross over to pricier <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html\">midrange handsets</a> (if you're open to spending more, we shouted out a couple of our favorite flagship phones at the very end of this guide).</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>But for those with a little wiggle room, there are some things to consider. For example, a child may be better off with a cheaper device, especially if it’s intended mainly for emergencies, WiFi browsing or texting parents (and not social media). On the higher end of this price spectrum, sub-$350 Samsung phones and other Android devices have come a long way thanks to improved performance, better phone cameras with low-light capabilities, fast charging, and nicer displays like AMOLED panels. This makes them a viable alternative to, say, a flagship handset with a premium design, even if you have the flexibility to spend more.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-cheap-android-phone\">What to look for in a cheap Android phone</h2> \n<p>When it comes to cheap phones, you get what you pay for. Most smartphones in this price range are made out of plastic, though the fit and finish of a specific model can vary a lot based on price. A bright screen is also important. Typically you’ll get LCD panels with a 60Hz or 90Hz refresh rate, but some phones may have OLED or AMOLED screens with increased color saturation. Long battery life is critical as well, so we tend to favor devices with larger power cells of around 5,000 mAh. In this price range, performance can vary a lot, so look for devices with at least 8GB of RAM and processors that can deliver stutter-free visuals. It’s also important to consider support length: as periodic security updates and lengthy software support can extend the longevity of your device, which will save you money in the long run.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-android-phone-faqs\">Android phone FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-price-difference-for-a-cheap-android-vs-a-cheap-iphone\">What's the price difference for a cheap Android vs a cheap iPhone?</h3> \n<p>iPhones tend to be more expensive compared to Android phones — even the cheapest iPhone, the iPhone SE, which starts from $429, is a harder pill to swallow compared to a cheap Android phone. In contrast, you can get your hands on a cheap Android device for as low as $100.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-android-phone-160029703.html?src=rss",

Despite its compact, curvy size, it also boasts a 6.1-ft-peak (1.9-m) cabin with a private bath and convertible dinette. As with other RVs, though, Barefoot pricing has risen steadily and is now close to double what it was 11 years ago. Happily, Barefoot has developed the new Bothy model to roll pricing back in time while simplifying the layout into a lighter, more spacious offering. It's a compelling entry point to the egg-camping experience.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/camping-trailers/barefoot-bothy-lightweight-egg-camper/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/camping-trailers/\">Camping Trailers</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/adventure-vehicles/\">Adventure Vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/outdoors/\">Outdoors</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/caravan/\" rel=\"tag\">Caravan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/teardrop-trailers/\" rel=\"tag\">teardrop trailers</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/trailers/\" rel=\"tag\">trailers</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/\" rel=\"tag\">Outdoors and Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/\" rel=\"tag\">Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/\" rel=\"tag\">RV</a></p>",

Along with releasing the teaser trailer above, developer Mega Crit shared some <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/\" target=\"_blank\">details</a> about its goals for this phase ahead of the game's official release.</p><p>&quot;<em>Slay the Spire</em> requires a lot of player feedback so we can balance content, add quality of life features, and make sure the game runs without issues,&quot; the developers explained. &quot;Early Access is also a chance for us to test experimental features, try exotic designs, identify niche problems, and helps us make sure the game is headed in the right direction.&quot; <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> is expected to be in early access for a year or two, or more generally &quot;until the game feels great.&quot;</p><p>Mega Crit has also revealed that it will be introducing a new co-op mode where up to four people can team up. This gameplay option will feature some unique cards just for multiplayer as well as some team-wide synergies.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the characters from <em>Slay the Spire</em> will be returning for the sequel alongside new ones. For anyone who hasn't yet experienced the original game, <em>Slay the Spire</em> is <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/slay-the-spire-ios-150017220.html\" target=\"_blank\">available</a> on iOS, including as <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-slay-the-spire-and-ridiculous-fishing-are-coming-to-apple-arcade-in-july-153459825.html\" target=\"_blank\">part of</a> Apple Arcade.

That title <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-axes-two-more-live-service-games-130048000.html\" target=\"_blank\">was cancelled</a> in 2025, alongside another game from Bend Studio. In the context of Sony's other live-service failures, the decision wasn't surprising. Sony shut down the servers for multiplayer shooter <em>Concord</em> just two weeks after its release. Not long after, it also closed <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-pulls-the-plug-on-concord-and-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-180321212.html\" target=\"_blank\">Firewalk Studios</a>, the developer behind the game.</p><p>Bluepoint Games was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-155507719.html\" target=\"_blank\">originally acquired</a> by Sony in 2021, when it seemed like the studio's expertise in remaking and remastering classic PlayStation games could be a major asset going forward. Why that changed isn't entirely clear, but Sony's mismanagement of its pivot into and out of publishing premium online multiplayer games may have played a role. Some of Sony's studios are still experimenting with live-service mechanics. Guerilla Games recently announced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/guerrilla-reveals-horizon-hunters-gathering-a-co-op-action-spin-off-for-ps5-and-pc-162058264.html\" target=\"_blank\">an online co-op game</a> set in its Horizon universe. <em>Destiny 2 </em>developer Bungie is also releasing its extraction shooter <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungies-marathon-arrives-on-march-5-193808588.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Marathon</em></a> in March. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-shutting-down-the-studio-behind-the-demons-souls-remake-195234213.html?src=rss",

They managed to disrupt Finland&#8217;s political order through threats of violence and symbolic kidnappings, in which they would capture political rivals and drive them to the Soviet border.</p>\n\t<p>They earned the support of center-right and moderate politicians who believed they could harness the passion and support of this radical nationalist group. The movement also included prominent businessmen, newspaper owners, and key members of the military.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>But after a few years, the country was able to right the ship:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Almost overnight, the Lapua movement collapsed. Within three years of its founding, this far-right faction was banned from Finnish politics, and democracy in Finland has been stable ever since.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>You can read more about the Lapua movement and how it was defeated in <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/democracys-near-misses/\">this article about democracy&#8217;s &#8220;near misses&#8221;</a>.</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>In November 1929, red-shirted communist youth paraded in the small Finnish village of Lapua, located in the country&#8217;s religious and conservative southern Ostrobothnian region. An angry mob of local farmers attacked the parade, stripped the participants of their shirts, and began beating the unlucky leftists. That seemingly isolated and chance incident sparked a &#8220;a series of events which proved almost fatal to parliamentary government in Finland.</p></blockquote>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Finland\">Finland</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>",

That said, there were a ton of cool new products on display at the Javits Center in New York City that set the stage for the rest of the year, so here's a quick look at some of the most interesting releases from the largest toy show in the Western Hemisphere.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-transformers-the-movie-40th-anniversary-figures-28-to-60\"><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/collections/the-transformers-the-movie\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Transformers: The Movie </em>40th anniversary figures</a> ($28 to $60)</h2><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>To celebrate the 40th anniversary of <em>Transformers: The Movie</em>, Hasbro is launching an <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U62UyYw7ek\" target=\"_blank\">apology tour</a> to make up for traumatizing theatergoers with the death of the most beloved Autobot back in 1986. To kick things off, Hasbro is releasing a handful of new figures alongside re-releases for some popular bots including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/transformers-studio-series-the-transformers-the-movie-leader-class-astrotrain/G21905X00?srsltid=AfmBOoqfDHC5xVvWabTc6P-MfWUbaUkgH8TozCODjikqwPM-agrTAHrB\" target=\"_blank\">Astrotrain</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/transformers-studio-series-the-transformers-the-movie-voyager-class-skywarp/G19315X00?srsltid=AfmBOorJcUnsU1uK8BaUEnGKRoN7gCwBY6ArYBsccQtCQXJhl5z7bzE6\" target=\"_blank\">Skywarp</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/transformers-studio-series-the-transformers-the-movie-leader-class-dinobot-snarl/G21885X00?srsltid=AfmBOopQzlhPkzfCcba4nQnstDA-lcJueg0JY52RBm5Sh9cMatsQIUg9\" target=\"_blank\">Snarl</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/transformers-studio-series-the-transformers-the-movie-voyager-class-shockwave/G21915X00?cgid=the-transformers-the-movie\" target=\"_blank\">Shockwave</a>.

These messages were first uncovered by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs\"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> in 2021 within discovery documents for the Epic Games v. Apple trial. In the conversation, Friedman says while some other platforms prioritize safety over privacy, Apple's priorities &quot;are the inverse.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The state further alleges that detection technology to help root out and report CSAM exists, but that Apple chooses not to implement it. Apple indeed considered <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-csam-detection-explainer-183029927.html\"><ins>scanning iCloud Photos for CSAM</ins></a> in 2021, but <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-advanced-data-protection-imessage-contact-key-183819737.html\"><ins>abandoned these plans</ins></a> after pushback stemming from privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>In 2024 Apple was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-sued-for-failing-to-implement-tools-that-would-detect-csam-in-icloud-202940984.html\"><ins>sued</ins></a> by a group of over 2,500 victims of child sexual abuse, citing nearly identical claims and alleging that Apple's failure to implement these features led to the victims' harm as images of them circulated through the company's servers. At the time Apple told Engadget, “child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we are committed to fighting the ways predators put children at risk. We are urgently and actively innovating to combat these crimes without compromising the security and privacy of all our users.&quot;</p>\n<p>The case in West Virginia would mark the first time a governmental body is bringing such an action against the iPhone maker. The state says it is seeking injunctive relief that would compel Apple to implement effective CSAM detection measures as well as damages. We have reached out to Apple for comment on the suit and will update if we hear back.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/west-virginia-is-suing-apple-alleging-negligence-over-csam-materials-164647648.html?src=rss",

It was the final major first-party Switch game ahead of the Switch 2’s arrival in June, and the last doomed Wii U game to be granted a second life on Nintendo’s infinitely more successful console. Nearly a year on, a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html\">Switch 2</a> update for one of the most technically impressive games Nintendo has ever published has finally arrived.</p>\n<p>Somewhat hilariously titled <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition </em>(you get the feeling Nintendo has started a naming convention it may come to regret here), the updated version of Monolith Soft’s sprawling sci-fi RPG now supports up to 60fps performance and 4K resolution when docked to a TV.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"51c7c26b0f22447683787b31105b2673\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The sprawling alien world of planet Mira, now enhanced on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NintendoSwitch2</a> with improved frame rates and up to 4K resolution in TV mode!<br /><br />Join the fight for survival in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/XenobladeChroniclesX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#XenobladeChroniclesX</a>: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, available now! <a href=\"https://t.co/raA1XhIimC\">pic.twitter.com/raA1XhIimC</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2024484113923571725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>As impressive as the Switch remake of the 2015 Wii U game was, given the frankly absurd size of its open-world setting, you could almost feel the hardware creaking under its weight every time you booted the game up, so this patch was much-needed. Unfortunately the graphical and performance enhancements aren’t free for anyone who already owns the Switch version of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>. A $5 upgrade pack is available on the eShop, and the Switch 2 game costs $65 on its own. A physical version is also arriving on April 16.</p>\n<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition </em>(again, won’t someone please think of us writers) was the last of a number of Xenoblade Chronicles games to make its way to Switch. It’s a bit different to the other entries in the series, with its hard sci-fi story, emphasis on side quests and completely seamless open world to explore. Also, stick with the game long enough and you can eventually fly around the entire planet of Mira in a giant mech, which is as fun as it sounds.</p>\n<p>Like the other games in the series, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>is a standalone experience, so don’t worry about jumping in if you’ve never played one before. The series’ signature MMO-like hybrid real-time combat system takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s part of what makes these games stand out from other RPG series.</p>\n<p>The other Xenoblade games in the Switch library, which are <em>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition</em>, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>, are yet to receive Switch 2 updates, but hopefully they'll arrive eventually too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-announces-surprise-switch-2-version-of-sci-fi-rpg-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-153121689.html?src=rss",

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.
