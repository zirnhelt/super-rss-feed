Earlier this week, the state's House Judiciary Committee voted in a 7-4 majority to pass the bill, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/HB26-1144\">HB26-1144</a>, along for a decision with the full House of Representatives. The proposed law would &quot;prohibit the use of a three-dimensional printer, or similar technology, to make a firearm or a firearm component.&quot;</p>\n<p><a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/manhattans-da-wants-to-know-why-youtube-is-pushing-ghost-gun-tutorials-to-kids-070219455.html\">Ghost guns</a> are typically made from 3D printers or similar machines without serial numbers, making them virtually impossible to trace and allowing users to skirt the federal requirements for purchasing a firearm. While the bill targets using a 3D printer to make guns, large-capacity magazines and other related components, it even bans possessing and distributing the instructions to manufacture guns in this way. However, these rules would be exempt for federally licensed firearm manufacturers.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;These ghost guns are increasingly found at crime scenes, making it harder for law enforcement to track down a suspect because the gun isn’t traceable,&quot; the bill's sponsor, Lindsay Gilchrist, said in a press release.</p>\n<p>Prior to this proposal, Colorado <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/colorado-bans-possession-creation-of-ghost-guns/\">passed a law</a> in 2023 that banned owning ghost guns or making frames for them. While SB23-279 laid the groundwork, HB26-1144 can be seen as the next step since it's much more encompassing by targeting ghost guns even before they're made. According to the bill, first-time violations will be treated as a misdemeanor, while repeat offenses will be upgraded to a felony charge. Looking ahead, HB26-1144 still has to secure a vote from both the Colorado Senate and House of Representatives before being delivered to the governor to be signed into law.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/colorado-is-working-on-a-bill-that-would-make-it-illegal-to-3d-print-firearms-and-gun-parts-211508169.html?src=rss",

It can also be initiated by quick-access physical controls. In a statement, Samsung's Won-Joon Choi, President, COO and Head of the R&amp;D Office for Samsung's Mobile eXperience Business, said the expansion of Galaxy AI is aimed at giving users more choice and flexibility in getting their tasks done. &quot;Galaxy AI acts as an orchestrator, bringing together different forms of AI into a single, natural, cohesive experience,” Choi said.</p><p>Samsung previously announced a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-made-a-tv-app-and-its-coming-to-samsung-sets-143000479.html\" target=\"_blank\">partnership with Perplexity</a> last year to integrate the company's AI search engine into Samsung TVs.&nbsp; Perplexity has been in hot water though over <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-is-allegedly-scraping-websites-its-not-supposed-to-again-211110756.html\" target=\"_blank\">alleged content scraping</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexity-sued-by-japanese-media-giants-for-stealing-information-and-presenting-false-information-133048116.html\" target=\"_blank\">copyright infringement</a>, and was even <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/perplexitys-definition-of-copyright-gets-it-sued-by-the-dictionary-213408625.html\" target=\"_blank\">sued in September by Merriam-Webster</a> — yes, the dictionary — and Encyclopedia Britannica.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsung-is-adding-perplexity-to-galaxy-ai-for-its-upcoming-s26-series-203729539.html?src=rss",

Red is definitely a departure from Apple's usual palette of more modest tones, but the company could be trying to continue the momentum of its flashier Cosmic Orange option that has been boosting <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2d78d04-7368-4b0c-abd5-591c03774c46\">sales in China</a>. The bold orange option has been informally rebranded as Hermès orange among fans and is becoming somewhat of a status symbol in Chinese markets. With red as a potential frontrunner for the next iPhone Pro colors, Apple could capture even <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-smartphone-sales-china-plummet.html\">more sales in China</a>, especially since the color is seen as lucky in Chinese culture.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It's not the first time Apple has offered red iPhones, though. Previously, Apple manufactured iPhones in deep red hues in collaboration with <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-gps-lte-product-red-edition-deal-amazon-123944170.html\">Product Red</a>, with the last available models being the iPhone SE, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. On the other hand, Gurman reported that Apple will play it much safer when it comes to the rumored <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-will-reportedly-bring-back-touch-id-on-a-foldable-iphone-135831748.html\">foldable iPhone</a>, sticking with its basic tones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-reportedly-considering-red-as-the-next-premium-color-for-its-iphones-185748052.html?src=rss",

According to <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-22/apple-s-ai-wearables-push-what-to-expect-from-march-4-low-end-macbook-launch\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s Mark Gurman, Apple will announce &quot;at least five products,&quot; starting on Monday, March 2, and extending to its scheduled &quot;experience&quot; on Wednesday, March 4.</p>\n<p>There's a long list of potential options that Apple could announce next month, but Gurman is confident in a few. According to the report, Apple is &quot;very likely&quot; to reveal the low-cost MacBook, especially considering the event logo's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-may-be-adding-a-splash-of-color-to-its-upcoming-budget-friendly-macbook-192740002.html\">choice of colors</a> that could reference the new laptop colors. Gurman also predicted that Apple could announce the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17e-will-reportedly-bring-some-key-upgrades-without-raising-the-price-174154577.html\">iPhone 17e</a>, since its predecessor was launched last spring, and an iPad Air that's updated with the M4 chip. Previous rumors point to Apple getting ready to drop the upgraded MacBook Pro, which will likely get M5 Pro and Max chips, and the new MacBook Air with the base M5 chip. If that wasn't enough, Apple could even debut the refreshed <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-mac-studio-m4-max-review-a-creative-powerhouse-123000265.html\">Mac Studio</a> and a new Apple Studio Display since the two desktop-oriented options were already expected to be released in the first half of the year.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There hasn't been any confirmation from Apple directly, but it may have left behind some hints for this &quot;three-day blitz&quot; of product announcements. Going off Apple's wording, the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/heres-what-to-expect-at-apples-product-launch-event-on-march-4-173612772.html\">March 4 event</a> will be an &quot;Apple Experience&quot; with locations in New York, London and Shanghai, which doesn't sound like the typical format of an event with keynote addresses that's paired with a livestream. Gurman also noted that Apple usually announces its new products on Tuesday, unlike the official Wednesday timing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-first-event-of-the-year-will-reportedly-bring-at-least-five-products-over-a-three-day-blitz-175017716.html?src=rss",

The feature is supported on iPhone models with satellite hardware, beginning with iPhone 14 and later. The device must be running a version of iOS (<a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0cf8bae0-8869-4c98-830a-b2eebb48d4bf&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=iOS+18+or+higher&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzLzEyMDkzMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGNmOGJhZTAtODg2OS00Yzk4LTgzMGEtYjJlZWJiNDhkNGJmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzLzEyMDkzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVawW2OetIgztQH6ZCmrWu9f6HIHY9uITW7D05T6sali&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2F120930\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 18 or higher</a>) that supports satellite messaging, which Apple has continued to refine through recent iOS updates.</p><p>The feature also depends on location and availability. Satellite messaging is currently supported in select regions, including the United States and parts of Canada, with expanded support rolling out gradually. The iPhone must be outdoors with a clear view of the sky, as trees, buildings and terrain can interfere with the satellite connection.</p><p>Satellite messaging is not designed for continuous conversations. Messages are compressed and sent at a slower pace than standard texts, and delivery times can vary depending on conditions and satellite positioning.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-satellite-messaging-works-on-iphone\"><strong>How satellite messaging works on iPhone</strong></h2><p>When an iPhone loses access to cellular and Wi-Fi networks, the system automatically detects that only satellite connectivity is available. Instead of failing to send, the Messages app prompts the user to connect to a satellite.</p><p>On-screen instructions guide the user to position the phone correctly. This typically involves holding the device up and following directional prompts to align it with an overhead satellite. The phone uses built-in sensors to help maintain the connection while the message is being sent.</p><p>Messages sent via satellite are text-only and use a reduced data format to ensure they can be transmitted reliably. Images, videos, audio messages and large attachments are not supported.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-who-can-receive-satellite-messages\"><strong>Who can receive satellite messages?</strong></h2><p>Satellite messages can be sent to contacts using iMessage or standard SMS, depending on the recipient’s device and settings. If the recipient is using an Apple device with iMessage enabled, the message will be delivered through Apple’s messaging system. If not, the message will be sent as a standard text.</p><p>Recipients do not need a satellite-capable device to receive messages. From their perspective, the message appears similar to a regular text, though delivery times may be longer.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-tips-for-getting-a-reliable-connection\"><strong>Tips for getting a reliable connection</strong></h2><p>A clear view of the sky is essential for satellite messaging to work properly. Open areas with minimal obstructions offer the best results. Movement, heavy foliage and nearby structures can interrupt the connection.</p><p>Because satellite bandwidth is limited, keeping messages short improves reliability and delivery speed. The iPhone may prompt the user to edit longer messages to fit within satellite constraints.</p><p>Battery life is also a consideration. Maintaining a satellite connection uses more power than standard messaging, so it helps to conserve battery when relying on satellite features for extended periods.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-limitations-to-keep-in-mind\"><strong>Limitations to keep in mind</strong></h2><p>Satellite messaging is designed for occasional use when other networks are unavailable. It does not support group messages, media attachments or read receipts in the same way as standard messaging.</p><p>Delivery times can range from under a minute to several minutes, depending on environmental conditions and satellite availability. The feature should not be relied upon for time-sensitive communication unless no other option is available.</p><p>Apple has also noted that satellite features may be offered free for a limited period, with potential pricing or subscription requirements introduced in the future depending on region and carrier arrangements.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-satellite-messaging-can-be-useful\"><strong>When satellite messaging can be useful</strong></h2><p>Messaging via satellite can be helpful for travelers, hikers and anyone spending time in remote areas where coverage is unreliable. It offers a way to check in, share basic updates or request non-emergency assistance when traditional networks are unavailable.</p><p>While it is not a replacement for emergency services, it complements Apple’s existing emergency satellite features by providing an additional communication option when users are off the grid.</p><p>As Apple continues to expand satellite support, messaging via satellite is likely to become a more familiar part of the iPhone experience, particularly for users who regularly venture beyond the reach of cellular networks.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-send-a-message-via-satellite-on-iphone-130000418.html?src=rss",

In a <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNVKqRDalLo\">YouTube video</a>, the campaign's creator, Ross Scott, explained that organizers are planning to establish two non-governmental organizations, one for the European Union and another for the US. According to Scott, these NGOs would allow for &quot;long-term counter lobbying&quot; when publishers end support for certain video games.</p>\n<p>&quot;Let me start off by saying I think we're going to win this, namely the problem of publishers destroying video games that you've already paid for,&quot; Scott said in the video. According to Scott, the NGOs will work on getting the original Stop Killing Games petition codified into EU law, while also pursuing more watchdog actions, like setting up a system to report publishers for revoking access to purchased video games.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html\">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign started as a reaction to Ubisoft's delisting of <em>The Crew</em> from players' libraries. The controversial decision stirred up concerns about how publishers have the ultimate say on delisting video games. After crossing <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-movement-is-nearing-an-official-meeting-with-eu-lawmakers-191535413.html\">a million signatures</a> last year, the movement's leadership has been busy exploring the next steps.</p>\n<p>According to Scott, the campaign leadership will meet with the European Commission soon, but is also working on a 500-page legal paper that reveals some of the industry's current controversial practices. In the meantime, the ongoing efforts have led to a change of heart from Ubisoft since the publisher updated <em>The Crew 2</em> with <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-crew-2-is-now-playable-offline-211629508.html\">an offline mode</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-stop-killing-games-campaign-will-set-up-ngos-in-the-eu-and-us-203359604.html?src=rss",

On Friday, US District Judge Beth Bloom upheld the jury's decision to hold Tesla partially responsible for a deadly crash that happened in 2019 and involved the self-driving <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-stops-using-autopilot-to-promote-its-evs-in-california-112533060.html\">Autopilot</a> feature.</p>\n<p>The judge added that there was enough evidence to support the jury's verdict, which was delivered in August 2025 and ordered Tesla to pay millions in compensatory and punitive damages to the two victims in the case. Judge Bloom added that Tesla didn't present any new arguments to dispute the decision.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>While the case has been moving along recently, the incident dates back to several years ago when the driver of a <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/teslas-updated-model-y-performance-launches-for-57490-123018911.html\">Model S</a>, George McGee, was using Tesla's Autopilot feature while bending down to retrieve a dropped phone. The Model S then crashed into an SUV that was parked on a shoulder, where Naibel Benavides Leon and Dillon Angulo were standing aside. Benavides was killed in the crash, while Angulo was severely injured.</p>\n<p>Tesla hasn't publicly commented on Judge Bloom's decision yet, but it won't be a surprise to see the company appeal the latest ruling with a higher court. Tesla's lawyers previously tried to pin the blame on the driver, claiming that the Model S and Autopilot weren't defective. As this major case plays out, Tesla is also facing several investigations from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for both its <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/feds-investigate-tesla-over-inaccurate-autopilot-and-fsd-crash-reports-175837772.html\">Autopilot</a> and <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/nhtsa-launches-probe-into-teslas-full-self-driving-tech-141102274.html\">Full-Self Driving</a> features.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-judge-ruled-tesla-still-has-to-pay-243-million-for-a-fatal-crash-involving-autopilot-174548093.html?src=rss",

But because AirTags and other Bluetooth trackers are small and discreet, concerns about unwanted tracking are understandable. Apple has spent years building safeguards into the AirTag and the Find My network to reduce the risk of misuse and to alert people if a tracker they don’t own appears to be moving with them.</p><p>If you’re worried about whether an AirTag or similar tracker might be following you, here’s how Apple’s unwanted tracking alerts work, what notifications to look for and what you can do on both iPhone and Android.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-airtag-tracking-alerts-work\">How AirTag tracking alerts work</h2><p>AirTags, compatible Find My network accessories and certain AirPods models use Apple’s Find My network, which relies on Bluetooth signals and nearby devices to update their location. To prevent misuse, Apple designed these products with features that are meant to alert someone if a tracker that isn’t linked to their Apple Account appears to be traveling with them.</p><p>If an AirTag or another compatible tracker is separated from its owner and detected near you over time, your device may display a notification or the tracker itself may emit a sound. These alerts are intended to discourage someone from secretly tracking another person without their knowledge. Apple has also worked with Google on a cross-platform industry standard, so alerts can appear on both iOS and Android devices, not just iPhones.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-make-sure-tracking-alerts-are-enabled-on-your-iphone\">How to make sure tracking alerts are enabled on your iPhone</h2><p>If you use an iPhone or iPad, tracking notifications are on by default, but it’s worth confirming your settings.</p><p>To receive unwanted tracking alerts, make sure that:</p><ul><li><p>Your device is running iOS 17.5 or later (or iPadOS 17.5 or later). Earlier versions back to iOS 14.5 support basic AirTag alerts, but newer versions add broader compatibility with other trackers.</p></li><li><p>Bluetooth is turned on.</p></li><li><p>Location Services are enabled.</p></li><li><p>Notifications for Tracking Alerts are allowed.</p></li><li><p>Airplane Mode is turned off.</p></li></ul><p>You can check these by opening <strong>Settings</strong>, then navigating to <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, <strong>Location Services and Notifications</strong>. Apple also recommends turning on <strong>Significant Locations</strong> in the <strong>System Services </strong>menu, which helps your device determine when an unknown tracker has traveled with you to places like your home.</p><ol><li><p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>, tap <strong>Privacy &amp; Security</strong>, then select <strong>Location Services</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Toggle <strong>Location Services</strong> on.</p></li><li><p>Scroll down and tap <strong>System Services</strong>, then toggle <strong>Significant Locations</strong> on.</p></li></ol><p>If these settings are disabled, your iPhone may not be able to alert you when an AirTag or similar device is nearby.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-tracking-alerts-look-like\">What tracking alerts look like</h2><p>If your iPhone detects a tracker that doesn’t belong to you moving with you, you may see a notification such as:</p><ul><li><p>AirTag Found Moving With You</p></li><li><p>AirPods Detected</p></li><li><p>“Product Name” Found Moving With You</p></li><li><p>Unknown Accessory Detected</p></li></ul><p>Tapping the alert opens the Find My app, which shows a map of where the item was detected near you. The map uses dots to indicate locations where your device noticed the tracker nearby. This doesn’t mean the owner was actively watching your location at those times, only that the tracker was detected in close proximity.</p><p>In some cases, the alert may have an innocent explanation. For example, you might be borrowing someone else’s keys, bag or AirPods. If the item belongs to someone in your Family Sharing group, you can temporarily pause alerts for that item by tapping the notification and opting to turn off alerts for that item either for one day or indefinitely.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-do-if-you-hear-an-airtag-making-a-sound\">What to do if you hear an AirTag making a sound</h2><p>If an AirTag or compatible tracker has been separated from its owner for a period of time and is moved, it may emit a sound on its own. This is another built-in safety feature meant to draw attention to the device.</p><p>If you hear an unfamiliar chirping or beeping sound, especially from a bag, jacket pocket or vehicle, it’s worth checking your belongings to see if there’s an AirTag or similar tracker inside.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-find-an-unknown-airtag-or-tracker\">How to find an unknown AirTag or tracker</h2><p>If you receive an alert and believe the tracker is still with you, the Find My app offers tools to help locate it.</p><p>From the alert, you can choose to play a sound on the device to help pinpoint where it’s hidden.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>Tap the alert.</p></li><li><p>Tap Continue and then tap <strong>Play Sound</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Listen for the sound or play it again to give yourself more time to find the item.</p></li></ol><p>If the tracker is an AirTag and you have a compatible iPhone with ultra wideband connectivity, you may also see a Find Nearby option, which uses Precision Finding to guide you toward it with distance and direction indicators.</p><ol><li><p>Tap the alert.</p></li><li><p>Tap <strong>Continue</strong> and then tap <strong>Find Nearby</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Follow the onscreen instructions. You may need to move around the space until your iPhone connects to the unknown AirTag.</p></li></ol><p>Your iPhone will display the distance and direction of the unknown AirTag, so you can use that information to identify where the unknown AirTag is. When the AirTag is within Bluetooth range of your iPhone, you can tap the <strong>Play Sound</strong> button to listen for it. You can also tap the <strong>Turn Flashlight On</strong> button to provide more light if it’s needed.</p><p>If neither option is available, or if the tracker can’t be located electronically, manually check your belongings. Look through bags, pockets, jackets and vehicles. If you feel unsafe and can’t find the device, Apple recommends going to a safe public place and contacting local law enforcement.</p><figure><img alt=\"The new Apple AirTag that works with Find My app.\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/c6e02161-a1fc-11eb-beff-7f401728d6fb\" style=\"height: 1742px; width: 1306px;\" /><figcaption>The new Apple AirTag that works with Find My app.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Apple</div></figure><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-get-information-about-an-airtag\">How to get information about an AirTag</h2><p>If you find an unknown AirTag, you can learn more about it without needing to unlock it or log in.</p><ol><li><p>Hold the top of your iPhone, or any NFC-capable smartphone, near the white side of the AirTag. A notification should appear.</p></li><li><p>Tap the notification to open a webpage with details about the AirTag. This page includes the serial number and the last four digits of the phone number associated with the owner’s Apple Account.</p></li></ol><p>If the AirTag was marked as lost, the page may also include a message from the owner explaining how to contact them. This can help determine whether the situation is accidental or intentional.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-disable-an-airtag-that-isnt-yours\">How to disable an AirTag that isn’t yours</h2><p>If you confirm that an AirTag is tracking you and it doesn’t belong to you, you can disable it so it stops sharing its location.</p><p>From the Find My alert or information page, select <strong>Instructions to Disable</strong> and follow the steps provided. For an AirTag, this usually involves removing the battery, which immediately stops location updates. Disabling Bluetooth or turning off Location Services on your phone does not stop the AirTag from reporting its location. The device itself must be disabled.</p><p>If you believe the tracker was used for malicious purposes, keep the AirTag and document its details before contacting law enforcement.

With alerts, audible warnings and cross-platform detection on both iOS and Android, most people will be notified if a tracker they don’t own is moving with them. Knowing what these alerts look like and how to respond can help you stay informed, avoid unnecessary panic and take appropriate action if something feels off.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-know-if-an-airtag-is-tracking-you-130000764.html?src=rss",

Whether you missed our in-depth testing of Sony’s latest flagship earbuds or a truly unique ASUS laptop, I’ve compiled our recent reviews so you can get up to speed quickly. Read on for the list that also includes a love letter to a tiny camera and another VPN option that worth considering. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-sony-wf-1000xm6\">Sony WF-1000XM6</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Sony’s 1000X earbuds have always been the top pick in our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html\" target=\"_blank\">best wireless earbuds</a> guide. With <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-facing-tougher-competition-160000652.htmlhttps://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-facing-tougher-competition-160000652.html\" target=\"_blank\">the M6</a> though, the company doesn’t do enough to clearly separate itself from the competition like it has in the past. “The two most obvious places the company is lagging behind the competition is ANC performance and overall voice quality, not to mention my continued dissatisfaction with the fit that Sony’s foam tips provide,” I wrote. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-asus-zenbook-duo-2026\">ASUS Zenbook Duo (2026)</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>If you’re looking for something unique in your next laptop, the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-zenbook-duo-2026-review-two-screens-really-are-better-than-one-140000982.html\" target=\"_blank\">ASUS Zenbook Duo</a> is worth considering. Dual screens? Yep. Detachable keyboard? Sure. Good battery life? It does that too. “I'm a believer that one day people will eventually embrace typing on screens with laptops just like they have for smartphones,” senior reporter Sam Rutherford explained. “However, even if you're not willing to make that jump just yet, the Zenbook Duo still has all of its bases covered.” </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-kodak-charmera\">Kodak Charmera</h2>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"A Kodak Charmera is shown pinched between two fingers, with snow and trees seen in the background\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/charm.jpg\" style=\"height: 1080px; width: 1920px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  It's so cute\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Cheyenne MacDonald for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>A tiny $30 camera was too cute for our editors to resist.

And being so tiny, it's really convenient to bring everywhere.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-mullvad-vpn\">Mullvad VPN</h2>\n<p>Senior writer Sam Champman’s latest VPN review is Mullvad, which he says is often regarded as one of the best in terms of overall privacy. “It's not trying to be an everything app — it does privacy and does it well,” he noted. “Of course, it has its own compromises. It's solidly in the middle of the speed pack and occasionally trips up when unblocking streaming sites. The lack of any protocols other than WireGuard grates on me a bit, since it reduces the user's options for troubleshooting.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-sony-wf-1000xm6-asus-zenbook-duo-and-more-130000298.html?src=rss",
