Its small size is perfect for cozying up on the couch or to use on your daily commute.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Apple released this iPad mini in late 2024 and it was a solid update. We gave it an 83 in our review thanks to the power of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-unveils-a17-pro-a-3nm-chip-powering-iphone-15-pro-182113747.html\">A17 Pro chip</a> and that it comes with a minimum of 128GB of storage. The model currently on sale comes with 128GB, Wi-Fi and all four color options: Blue, Purple, Space Gray and Starlight.&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>We named the Apple iPad mini <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html\">our favorite compact iPad</a> — though, to be fair, its only competitor is itself. Still, it's a good iPad with an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, Apple Intelligence and 12MP Wide back and 12MP Ultra Wide cameras. For 20 percent off, it's a great option for a light, useful way to entertain yourself through the rest of winter and beyond.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>Check out our coverage of the </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/best-apple-deals-150020110.html\"><em>best Apple deals</em></a><em> for more discounts, and follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-latest-ipad-mini-is-100-off-right-now-140900983.html?src=rss",

Less than a week after companies like Oracle took <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-finalizes-deal-for-its-us-entity-010543484.html\">ownership of TikTok's domestic operations</a>, the platform faced a major power outage when one of its primary US data center sites — run by Oracle — got taken down by the storm.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The problems started last Monday, January 26, when TikTok announced it was working on a &quot;major infrastructure issue&quot; and warned of bugs, time-out requests, missing earnings, and more. The next day TikTok shared that progress has been made but there were still some issues. It added, &quot;Creators may temporarily see '0' views or likes on videos, and your earnings may look like they're missing. This is a display error caused by server timeouts; your actual data and engagement are safe.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Then, yesterday, February 1, TikTok claimed the problem was straightened out and that users shouldn't experience any more related issues. &quot;We're sorry about the issues experienced by our U.S. community. We appreciate how much you count on TikTok to create, discover, and connect with what matters to you,&quot; the platform stated in its update. &quot;Thank you for your patience and understanding.&quot;</p>\n<p>A number of US users have <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/people-are-uninstalling-tiktok-and-downloading-an-indie-competitor-233345222.html\">uninstalled TikTok</a> in response to its new ownership and technical issues. Some users also claimed that TikTok was censoring what they could post or what others saw. For instance, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/01/tiktok-first-week\"><em>The Guardian</em> reports</a> that many people faced issues sharing videos about ICE agents killing Alex Pretti and general anti-ICE content.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On January 26, analytics firm <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/26/tiktok-uninstalls-are-up-150percent-following-us-joint-venture.html\">Sensor Tower told <em>CNBC</em></a> that uninstalls of the app had increased by over 150 percent during the five days since its change in ownership, when compared to the three months before. At the same time, independent app and competitor <a href=\"https://upscrolled.com/en/\">UpScrolled</a> saw a surge in downloads.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/tiktok-says-its-back-to-normal-after-winter-storm-related-outages-114848212.html?src=rss",

      "content_html": "<img src=\"https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.engadget.com&sz=128\" style=\"width:100%;max-height:300px;object-fit:cover;\" />\n<p>Noise-canceling earbuds have become an everyday essential for a lot of people, whether you’re trying to survive a noisy commute, concentrate in a shared workspace or just carve out a little quiet time. Advances in active noise cancellation and audio processing mean today’s best earbuds do a much better job of cutting through background noise, without forcing you to move up to bulky over-ear headphones.<br /><br />The latest models also balance sound quality with convenience, offering stable Bluetooth connections, comfortable fits and battery life that can last through a full day with help from their charging cases. From premium options with the strongest ANC to more affordable picks that still get the basics right, there’s no shortage of solid choices depending on what you value most.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-noise-cancelling-earbuds-for-2026\">Best noise-cancelling earbuds for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-noise-canceling-earbuds-for-you\">How to choose the best noise-canceling earbuds for you</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>Most true wireless earbuds these days have a “traditional” design that’s a round bud that fits in your ear canals. However, there are some variations on the formula in terms of shape, size and additional fitting elements. Some companies include fins or fit wings to help hold their in-ear earbuds in place while others opt for an over-the-ear hook on more <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html\">sporty models</a>. You’ll want to pay attention to these things to make sure they align with how you plan to use them. Also consider overall size and weight since those two factors can impact the fit. A less-than-ideal seal due to a weird fit will affect the performance of active noise-canceling earbuds.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of earbuds offer. You’ll see terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>the outside of the device to detect ambient noise. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it’s at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups or ear tips. Adaptive ANC is also better at combating wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using earbuds outdoors. For this top pick list of the best noise-canceling earbuds, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise in noisy environments.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of earbuds offers presets or adjustable levels of noise reduction. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that either provide maximum noise-blocking or prioritize energy efficiency. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-earbuds\">How we test noise-canceling earbuds</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for ANC earbuds is typically 6-10 hours, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). When necessary, I’ll power the headphones off during a review without putting them back in the case. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to wear them for an entire day.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use the earbuds in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I also use them during air travel, since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I’m not slated to hop on a flight, I simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well earbuds block human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC setups.</p> \n<p>I also do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double-checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set, and revisit the closest competition as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-earbuds-150026857.html?src=rss",

On the other end of the spectrum, Gurman's <em>Power On</em> newsletter mentioned that Apple is considering a larger foldable that opens like a book. Previously, Gurman said that Apple considered a foldable that's more akin to the size of an iPad.

As first spotted by <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3048329/apple-just-completely-changed-how-you-buy-a-new-mac.html\"><em>MacWorld</em></a>, Apple updated its <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro\">online configuration tool</a> for purchasing a Mac. Compared to the previous design that allowed you to pick between several prebuilt options, the new configurator lets you choose one spec after another instead.</p>\n<p>It's not a major difference compared to choosing between preconfigured options, but interested buyers have more customization since they can select the color, display, chip, memory, storage and even power adapter. The updated page also gives customers the option to add pre-installed apps, like Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro, to their new Mac.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The updated configuration design might hint towards the expected release of the upgraded MacBook Pros. According to <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3030240/m5-pro-max-macbook-pro-performance-speed-graphics-configurations.html\"><em>MacWorld</em></a>, there are rumors that Apple will offer the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips with more flexibility that lets you choose how many CPU and GPU cores you want. As reported by <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-01/apple-s-record-quarter-and-ai-changes-macbook-pro-update-clamshell-iphone-fold\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s Mark Gurman, the latest MacBook Pro could be queued up for a release alongside macOS 26.3, which has a release cycle between February and March.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apples-online-store-now-lets-you-build-a-new-mac-exactly-the-way-you-want-190430251.html?src=rss",

The country's Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs released <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.komdigi.go.id/berita/siaran-pers/detail/kemkomdigi-awasi-ketat-normalisasi-grok-usai-x-sampaikan-komitmen-kepatuhan\">a statement</a> earlier today, which said X is allowed to resume service in Indonesia but will be subject to monitoring for any future violations.</p>\n<p>According to the Indonesian government agency, X provided a letter that detailed several implemented measures that prevent the misuse of its Grok chatbot. Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space supervision, said in the statement that the agency will test the new measures on an ongoing basis and will ban Grok again if it's found spreading illegal content or violating the country's laws regarding children.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The issue dates back to earlier this year, when Indonesia, along with Malaysia and the Philippines, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7y10xm4x2o\">banned the AI chatbot</a> after it was found producing sexually explicit deepfake images of women and children without their consent in response to user requests. Later that month, the Philippines lifted its ban on Grok, followed by <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/malaysia-lifts-ban-on-grok-after-taking-x-at-its-word-144457468.html\">Malaysia</a> doing the same just a couple of days after. Similar to Indonesia, Malaysian authorities said they will continue to monitor Grok and threatened more enforcement actions if the AI chatbot repeats its past offenses. Beyond the bans, Grok is also facing investigations from California's <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-is-investigating-grok-over-ai-generated-csam-and-nonconsensual-deepfakes-202029635.html\">attorney general</a> and the UK's <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-regulator-ofcom-opens-a-formal-investigation-into-x-over-csam-scandal-120000312.html\">media regulator</a> concerning the same issue.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/indonesia-is-lifting-its-ban-on-grok-but-with-some-conditions-175305634.html?src=rss",

Unlike many small trackers, an AirTag doesn’t need to be charged. Instead, it uses a standard replaceable coin cell battery that typically lasts around a year, depending on usage.</p><p>When the battery runs low, your iPhone will alert you. Replacing it is a simple process that takes just a few minutes and doesn’t require any tools. This guide explains how to tell when your AirTag battery needs replacing, which battery to use and how to swap it safely.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-replace-the-battery-in-your-airtag\">How to replace the battery in your AirTag</h2><p>Replacing the battery only takes a few steps.</p><ol><li><p>Hold the AirTag with the polished stainless steel side facing up.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Press down firmly on the metal battery cover and rotate it counterclockwise.

Align the three small tabs on the cover with the matching slots on the AirTag body.</p></li><li><p>Press down gently and rotate the cover clockwise until it stops. The cover should sit flush with the AirTag and feel secure once locked into place.</p></li></ol><p>No pairing or setup steps are required after replacing the battery. Your AirTag will automatically reconnect to your Apple ID.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-to-replace-your-airtag-battery\">When to replace your AirTag battery</h2><p>Your iPhone will automatically notify you when an AirTag battery is running low. The alert appears as a notification and doesn’t interrupt tracking, but it’s a good idea to replace the battery quickly to avoid losing location updates.</p><p>If you’re unsure whether your AirTag battery needs replacing, open the <strong>Find My app</strong>, tap the <strong>Items</strong> tab and select your <strong>AirTag</strong>. If a message appears under the AirTag name stating “Low Battery”, you’ll know it needs replacing. If no message appears, it’s safe to assume the battery level is fine for now. AirTags don’t have a screen or any other battery indicator, but Apple does show a battery percentage for AirTags in the FindMy app. The low battery warning is the only signal Apple provides before replacement becomes necessary.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-do-if-your-airtag-doesnt-make-a-sound\">What to do if your AirTag doesn’t make a sound</h2><p>If you don’t hear a sound after inserting the new battery, remove it and check that it’s oriented correctly with the positive side facing up. You should also secure the back cover onto the AirTag as well, to see if the chime sounds after that.</p><p>If the battery is oriented properly and still doesn’t trigger a sound, try a different CR2032 battery. AirTag uses a CR2032 lithium 3V coin battery, a common type available at most electronics stores, supermarkets and pharmacies. Some batteries, particularly those with thick coatings, may not make consistent contact. Apple suggests looking for packaging that states “Compatible with AirTag.” Once a working battery is installed, the AirTag should resume normal operation immediately.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-often-should-you-replace-your-airtag-battery\">How often should you replace your AirTag battery</h2><p>Most AirTag batteries last about a year under typical use. Frequent use of Precision Finding, sound playback or location updates may reduce battery life. iOS will notify you before the battery is fully depleted, so there’s no need to replace it preemptively unless you’re preparing for long-term travel or storage.</p><p>Used coin batteries should not be thrown in household trash. Many retailers and recycling centers accept lithium batteries for proper disposal. Check local recycling guidelines for battery drop-off locations. Storing used batteries in a secure container until they can be recycled helps reduce the risk of accidental contact or ingestion.</p><p>Replacing an AirTag battery is one of the simplest maintenance tasks Apple devices require. With a readily available battery and no tools involved, most users can complete the process in under a minute. As long as you pay attention to low battery notifications and follow basic safety precautions, your AirTag should continue tracking your belongings reliably with minimal effort.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html?src=rss",
