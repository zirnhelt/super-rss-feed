      "title": "Mark Zuckerberg was initially opposed to parental controls for AI chatbots, according to legal filing",
      "content_html": "<p>Meta has faced some serious questions about how it allows its underage users to interact with AI-powered chatbots. Most recently, internal communications obtained by the New Mexico Attorney General's Office revealed that although Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was opposed to the chatbots having &quot;explicit&quot; conversations with minors, he also rejected the idea of placing parental controls on the feature. </p><p><em>Reuters</em> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/meta-ceo-zuckerberg-blocked-curbs-sex-talking-chatbots-minors-court-filing-2026-01-27/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that in an exchange between two unnamed Meta employees, one wrote that we &quot;pushed hard for parental controls to turn GenAI off – but GenAI leadership pushed back stating Mark decision.” In its statement to the publication, Meta accused the New Mexico Attorney General of &quot;cherry picking documents to paint a flawed and inaccurate picture.&quot; New Mexico is suing Meta on charges that the company “failed to stem the tide of damaging sexual material and sexual propositions delivered to children;” the case is scheduled to go to trial in February. </p><p>Despite only being available for a brief time, Meta's chatbots have already accumulated quite a history of behavior that veers into offensive if not outright illegal. In <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-ai-chatbots-were-reportedly-able-to-engage-in-sexual-conversations-with-minors-193726679.html\" target=\"_blank\">April 2025</a>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> released an investigation that found Meta's chatbots could engage in fantasy sex conversations with minors, or could be directed to mimic a minor and engage in sexual conversation. The report claimed that Zuckerberg had wanted looser guards implemented around Meta's chatbots, but a spokesperson denied that the company had overlooked protections for children and teens.&nbsp;</p><p>Internal review documents revealed in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/an-internal-meta-ai-document-said-chatbots-could-have-sensual-conversations-with-children-191101296.html\" target=\"_blank\">August 2025</a> detailed several hypothetical situations of what chatbot behaviors would be permitted, and the lines between sensual and sexual seemed pretty hazy. The document also permitted the chatbots to argue racist concepts. At the time, a representative told Engadget that the offending passages were hypotheticals rather than actual policy, which doesn't really seem like much of an improvement, and that they were removed from the document.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the multiple instances of questionable use of the chatbots, Meta only decided to suspend teen accounts' access to them <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-temporarily-pulling-teens-access-from-its-ai-chatbot-characters-180626052.html\" target=\"_blank\">last week</a>. The company said it is temporarily removing access while it develops the parental controls that Zuckerberg had allegedly rejected using.</p><p>&quot;Parents have long been able to see if their teens have been chatting with AIs on Instagram, and in October we announced our plans to go further, building new tools to give parents more control over their teens’ experiences with AI characters,&quot; a representative from Meta said. &quot;Last week we once again reinforced our commitment to delivering on our promise of parental controls for AI, pausing teen access to AI characters completely until the updated version is ready.&quot;</p><p>New Mexico filed this lawsuit against Meta in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-faces-another-lawsuit-over-child-safety-164732291.html\" target=\"_blank\">December 2023</a> on claims that the company's platforms failed to protect minors from harassment by adults.

      "title": "Meta blocks links to ICE List, a Wiki that names agents",
      "content_html": "<p>Meta has started blocking links to ICE List, a website that compiles information about incidents involving Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol agents, and lists thousands of their employees' names. It seems that the latter detail is what caused Meta to take action in a move that was first <a class=\"no-affiliate-link link\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/meta-is-blocking-links-to-ice-list-on-facebook-instagram-and-threads/\" target=\"_blank\">reported by</a> <em>Wired</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>ICE List is a crowdsourced Wiki that describes itself as &quot;an independently maintained public documentation project focused on immigration-enforcement activity&quot; in the US. &quot;Its purpose is to record, organize, and preserve verifiable information about enforcement actions, agents, facilities, vehicles, and related incidents that would otherwise remain fragmented, difficult to access, or undocumented,&quot; its website states.</p><p>Along with notable incidents, the website also lists the names of individual agents associated with ICE, CBP and other DHS agencies. According to <a class=\"no-affiliate-link link\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-agents-are-doxing-themselves/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Wired</em></a>, the website's creators said much of that information had come from a &quot;leak,&quot; though it appears to be based largely on public LinkedIn profiles. As <em>Wired </em>notes:</p><blockquote><p>The site went viral earlier this month when it claimed to have uploaded a leaked list of 4,500 DHS employees to its site, but a WIRED analysis found that the list relied heavily on information the employees shared publicly about themselves on sites such as LinkedIn.</p></blockquote><p>Links to ICE List have been spreading widely for several weeks, including on Meta's platforms. There are numerous links to the website on Threads, some of which go back several weeks. Now though, clicking on previously-shared links instead results in a message that the link can't be opened. Users who try to share new links on Threads or Facebook also see error messages. &quot;Posts that look like spam according to our Community Guidelines are blocked on Facebook and can't be edited,&quot; the notice says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When reached for comment, a Meta spokesperson pointed to the company's privacy policy barring the disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). The company didn't address why it chose to start blocking the website after several weeks, or whether it considers public LinkedIn profiles to be in violation of its rules against doxxing. </p><p>It is, however, not the first time Meta has opted to remove users' posts tracking information about ICE actions. The social network previously took down a Facebook group that <a class=\"no-affiliate-link link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/technology/meta-removes-ice-facebook-page.html\" target=\"_blank\">tracked ICE sightings</a> in Chicago <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-removes-facebook-group-for-tracking-ice-agents-after-doj-pressure-203429574.html\" target=\"_blank\">after pressure</a> from the Justice Department. </p><p><em>Have a tip for Karissa?

As you'd expect from any service operator in this day and age, there's some AI involved. Adobe has improved the tools for Generative Fill, Generative Expand and Remove that are powered by its Firefly generative AI platform. Using these tools for image editing should now produce results in 2K resolution with fewer artifacts and increased detail all while delivering better matches for the provided prompts. The Reference Image option for Generative Fill has also been upgraded to deliver &quot;geometry-aware results that better match the scene.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;One of the other new updates is a beta version of Dynamic Text, which should allow simpler transformation of a text layer into a curved shape. Photoshop has also added new adjustment layers: Clarity, Dehaze and Grain. These allow non-destructive image editing on layers.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/adobe-photoshop-upgrades-its-firefly-powered-generative-ai-editing-tools-213737915.html?src=rss",

      "title": "Astronomers discover over 800 cosmic anomalies using a new AI tool",
      "content_html": "<p>Here's a use of AI that appears to do more good than harm. A pair of astronomers at the European Space Agency (ESA) <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://esahubble.org/news/heic2603/?lang\" target=\"_blank\">developed</a> a neural network that searches through space images for anomalies. The results were far beyond what human experts could have done. In two and a half days, it sifted through nearly 100 million image cutouts, discovering 1,400 anomalous objects.</p><p>The creators of the AI model, David O'Ryan and Pablo Gómez, call it AnomalyMatch. The pair trained it on (and applied it to) the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://hla.stsci.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Hubble Legacy Archive</a>, which houses tens of thousands of datasets from Hubble's 35-year history. &quot;While trained scientists excel at spotting cosmic anomalies, there's simply too much Hubble data for experts to sort through at the necessary level of fine detail by hand,&quot; the ESA wrote in its press release.</p><p>After less than three days of scanning, AnomalyMatch returned a list of likely anomalies. It still requires human eyes at the end: Gómez and O'Ryan reviewed the candidates to confirm which were truly abnormal. Among the 1,400 anomalous objects the pair confirmed, more than 800 were previously undocumented.</p><p>Most of the results showed galaxies merging or interacting, which can lead to odd shapes or long tails of stars and gas. Others were gravitational lenses. (That's where the gravity of a foreground galaxy bends spacetime so that the light from a background galaxy is warped into a circle or arc.) Other discoveries included planet-forming disks viewed edge-on, galaxies with huge clumps of stars and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish_galaxy\" target=\"_blank\">jellyfish galaxies</a>. Adding a bit of mystery, there were even &quot;several dozen objects that defied classification altogether.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This is a fantastic use of AI to maximize the scientific output of the Hubble archive,&quot; Gómez is quoted as saying in the ESA's announcement. &quot;Finding so many anomalous objects in Hubble data, where you might expect many to have already been found, is a great result. It also shows how useful this tool will be for other large datasets.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/astronomers-discover-over-800-cosmic-anomalies-using-a-new-ai-tool-205135155.html?src=rss",

Django has a really nice built-in admin\ninterface, and I can customize it with just a little bit of code.</p>\n<p>For example, here&rsquo;s part of one of my admin classes, which sets up which fields\nto display in the &ldquo;list&rdquo; view,  which field to search on, and how to order them\nby default.</p>\n<pre><code>@admin.register(Zine)\nclass ZineAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n    list_display = [&quot;name&quot;, &quot;publication_date&quot;, &quot;free&quot;, &quot;slug&quot;, &quot;image_preview&quot;]\n    search_fields = [&quot;name&quot;, &quot;slug&quot;]\n    readonly_fields = [&quot;image_preview&quot;]\n    ordering = [&quot;-publication_date&quot;]\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"it-s-fun-to-have-an-orm\">it&rsquo;s fun to have an ORM</h3>\n<p>In the past my attitude has been &ldquo;ORMs? Who needs them? I can just write my own SQL queries!&rdquo;.\nI&rsquo;ve been enjoying Django&rsquo;s ORM so far though, and I think it&rsquo;s cool how Django\nuses <code>__</code> to represent a <code>JOIN</code>, like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Zine.objects\n    .exclude(product__order__email_hash=email_hash)\n</code></pre>\n<p>This query involves 5 tables: <code>zines</code>, <code>zine_products</code>, <code>products</code>, <code>order_products</code>, and <code>orders</code>.\nTo make this work I just had to tell Django that there&rsquo;s a <code>ManyToManyField</code>\nrelating &ldquo;orders&rdquo; and &ldquo;products&rdquo;, and another <code>ManyToManyField</code> relating\n&ldquo;zines&rdquo;, and &ldquo;products&rdquo;, so that it knows how to connect <code>zines</code>, <code>orders</code>, <code>products</code>.</p>\n<p>I definitely <em>could</em> write that query, but writing <code>product__order__email_hash</code> is\na lot less typing, it feels a lot easier to read, and honestly I think it would\ntake me a little while to figure out how to construct the query\n(which needs to do a few other things than just those joins).</p>\n<p>I have zero concern about the performance of my ORM-generated queries so I&rsquo;m\npretty excited about ORMs for now, though I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll find things to be\nfrustrated with eventually.</p>\n<h3 id=\"automatic-migrations\">automatic migrations!</h3>\n<p>The other great thing about the ORM is migrations!</p>\n<p>If I add, delete, or change a field in <code>models.py</code>, Django will automatically\ngenerate a migration script like <code>migrations/0006_delete_imageblob.py</code>.</p>\n<p>I assume that I could edit those scripts if I wanted, but so far I&rsquo;ve just\nbeen running the generated scripts with no change and it&rsquo;s been going great. It\nreally feels like magic.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m realizing that being able to do migrations easily is important for me right\nnow because I&rsquo;m changing my data model fairly often as I figure out how I want\nit to work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-like-the-docs\">I like the docs</h3>\n<p>I had a bad habit of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krMw1QTP2no\">never reading the documentation</a>\nbut I&rsquo;ve been really enjoying the parts of Django&rsquo;s docs that I&rsquo;ve read so far.\nThis isn&rsquo;t by accident: Jacob Kaplan-Moss has a\n<a href=\"https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2011/pycon-2011--writing-great-documentation.html\">talk from PyCon 2011</a>\non Django&rsquo;s documentation culture.</p>\n<p>For example the <a href=\"https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/6.0/topics/db/models/\">intro to models</a>\nlists the most important common fields you might want to set when using the ORM.</p>\n<h3 id=\"using-sqlite\">using sqlite</h3>\n<p>After having a bad experience trying to operate Postgres and not being able to\nunderstand what was going on, I decided to run all of my small websites with\nSQLite instead. It&rsquo;s been going way better, and I love being able to backup by\njust doing a <code>VACUUM INTO</code> and then copying the resulting single file.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been following <a href=\"https://alldjango.com/articles/definitive-guide-to-using-django-sqlite-in-production\">these instructions</a>\nfor using SQLite with Django in production.</p>\n<p>I think it should be fine because I&rsquo;m expecting the site to have a few hundred\nwrites per day at most, much less than <a href=\"https://messwithdns.net/\">Mess with DNS</a>\nwhich has a lot more of writes and has been working well (though the writes are\nsplit across 3 different SQLite databases).</p>\n<h3 id=\"built-in-email-and-more\">built in email (and more)</h3>\n<p>Django seems to be very &ldquo;batteries-included&rdquo;, which I love &ndash; if I want CSRF\nprotection, or a <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>, or I want to send email, it&rsquo;s all\nin there!</p>\n<p>For example, I wanted to save the emails Django sends to a file in dev mode (so\nthat it didn&rsquo;t send real email to real people), which was just a little bit\nof configuration.</p>\n<p>I just put this <code>settings/dev.py</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>EMAIL_BACKEND = &quot;django.core.mail.backends.filebased.EmailBackend&quot;\nEMAIL_FILE_PATH = BASE_DIR / &quot;emails&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and then set up the production email like this in <code>settings/production.py</code></p>\n<pre><code>EMAIL_BACKEND = &quot;django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend&quot;\nEMAIL_HOST = &quot;smtp.whatever.com&quot;\nEMAIL_PORT = 587\nEMAIL_USE_TLS = True\nEMAIL_HOST_USER = &quot;xxxx&quot;\nEMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.getenv('EMAIL_API_KEY')\n</code></pre>\n<p>That made me feel like if I want some other basic website feature, there&rsquo;s\nlikely to be an easy way to do it built into Django already.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-settings-file-still-feels-like-a-lot\">the settings file still feels like a lot</h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;m still a bit intimidated by the <code>settings.py</code> file: Django&rsquo;s settings system\nworks by setting a bunch of global variables in a file, and I feel a bit\nstressed about&hellip; what if I make a typo in the name of one of those variables?\nHow will I know? What if I type <code>WSGI_APPLICATOIN = &quot;config.wsgi.application&quot;</code>\ninstead of <code>WSGI_APPLICATION</code>?</p>\n<p>I guess I&rsquo;ve gotten used to having a Python language server tell me when I&rsquo;ve\nmade a typo and so now it feels a bit disorienting when I can&rsquo;t rely on the\nlanguage server support.</p>\n<h3 id=\"that-s-all-for-now\">that&rsquo;s all for now!</h3>\n<p>I haven&rsquo;t really successfully used an actual web framework for a project before\n(right now almost all of my websites are either a single Go binary or static\nsites), so I&rsquo;m interested in seeing how it goes!</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s still lots for me to learn about, I still haven&rsquo;t really gotten into\nDjango&rsquo;s form validation tooling or authentication systems.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Marco Rogers for convincing me to give ORMs a chance.</p>\n<p>(we&rsquo;re still experimenting with the comments-on-Mastodon system! <a href=\"https://comments.jvns.ca/post/115969229107460589\">Here are the comments on Mastodon</a>! tell me your favourite Django feature!)</p>",

The writers felt that by having the adults refuse to believe Big Bird despite the fact that he was telling the truth, they were scaring children into thinking that their parents would not believe them if they had been sexually abused and that they would just be better off remaining silent.</p></blockquote>\n\n        \n\n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Fred%20Rogers\">Fred Rogers</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sesame%20Street\">Sesame Street</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/TV\">TV</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/YouTube\">YouTube</a></p>",
