That's $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> \n<p>We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-the-disney-and-hulu-bundle-for-one-month-for-only-10-192814129.html?src=rss",

It was already considering spinning off the business back then.</p><p>“Specs are launching at an important time, as artificial intelligence transforms the way that we use our computers,” the company said in its announcement. The glasses’ operating system can help you get things done faster based on what they see and what they know about your behaviors. Snap also says that its smartglasses can keep you present in the moment with friends and family unlike phones and computers, since they superimpose digital tools over your view of the real world. In addition, the company believes Specs can help reduce waste over time as its digital tools can replace physical objects, such as manuals and whiteboards. </p><p>Snap didn’t say whether Specs Inc. already has investors lined up, but it is already hiring for <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://careers.snap.com/jobs?team=Spectacles\" target=\"_blank\">over 100 roles</a> around the world. The new subsidiary is expected to launch Snap's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/snap-says-new-lightweight-ar-glasses-will-come-in-2026-171020059.html\" target=\"_blank\">next generation of standalone AR glasses</a> sometime this year. Company CEO Evan Spiegel previously said that the model will be lighter, have a much smaller form factor and have more capabilities than its older smartglasses, which are mostly developer-focused. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/wearables/snap-is-spinning-off-its-ar-glasses-into-a-separate-business-140000659.html?src=rss",

      "content_html": "<p>LinkedIn has long been a platform for showing off professional accomplishments. Now, the company is leaning into the rise of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/16/1115135/what-is-vibe-coding-exactly/\" target=\"_blank\">vibe coding</a> by allowing users to show off their proficiency with various AI coding tools directly on their profiles.</p><p>The company is partnering with Replit, Lovabl, Descript and Relay.app&nbsp; on the feature and is working on integrations with fellow Microsoft-owned GitHub as well as Zapier.&nbsp; LinkedIn has always allowed users to add various skills and certifications to their profiles. But what makes the latest update a bit different is that users aren't self-reporting their own qualifications. Instead, LinkedIn is allowing the companies behind the AI tools to assess an individual's relative skill and assign a level of proficiency that goes directly to their profile.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, AI app maker Lovabl could award someone a &quot;bronze&quot; in &quot;vibe coding,&quot; while the platform Replit uses numerical levels and <a class=\"link\" href=\"http://Relay.app\" target=\"_blank\"><a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\">Relay.app</a></a> may determine that someone is an &quot;intermediate&quot; level &quot;AI Agent Builder,&quot; according to screenshots shared by LinkedIn. These levels should dynamically update as people get more experience using the relevant tools, according to LinkedIn. </p><figure><img alt=\"Lovabl's vibe coding rating system.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-27_at_16.04.45.png\" style=\"height: 150px; width: 744px;\" /><figcaption>Lovabl's vibe coding rating system.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">LinkedIn</div></figure><p>Of course, the update also comes at a time when companies have used these same kinds of AI tools to lay off thousands of workers. So while there's may be value in showing off your vibe coding skills, there are still many workers who likely aren't as excited about&nbsp; ceding more ground to AI. When I asked, LinkedIn's head of career products Pat Whealan about this he said that&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;AI-specific skills are an increasingly important signal to recruiters and the latest update will make it easier for them to assess candidates' skills. But he added that the intention isn't to make AI-specific skills the sole focus. &quot;This is less about replacing any of those other existing signals, and more about showing new ways that people are doing work,&quot; he tells Engadget. &quot;And how do we give a verifiable signal to both hirers and other people looking at their profile, that they actually are using these tools on a regular basis.&quot;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/linkedin-will-let-you-show-off-your-vibe-coding-expertise-140000776.html?src=rss",

      "title": "UK wants to give web publishers a 'fairer' deal with Google's AI overviews",
      "content_html": "<p>The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is recommending measures to give publishers more control over how their content is used in Google’s AI overviews. The aim is to “provide a fairer deal for content publishers, particularly news organizations,” the CMA’s chief executive Sarah Cardell said in a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-proposes-package-of-measures-to-improve-google-search-services-in-uk\" target=\"_blank\">press release</a>. </p><p>With Google accounting for more than 90 percent of search inquiries in the UK, the CMA recently <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-uks-antitrust-regulator-will-keep-a-closer-eye-on-google-search-130021994.html\" target=\"_blank\">designated</a> the company with “strategic market status” for search under the Digital Market Act. That allows the regulator to apply “conduct requirements” on Google to promote competition and avoid antitrust issues.</p><p>With those new powers, the CMA proposed a number of measures today. The first is a set of controls that would allow publishers to opt out of their content being used for features like AI Overviews or to train AI models. Google would also need to properly attribute publisher content. </p><p>Another measure would require Google to apply fair search result rankings for businesses, with an “effective process for raising and investigating issues.” Google would also need to provide a “choice screen” for alternative search options on Android mobile and Chrome browsers. </p><p>“These targeted and proportionate actions would give UK businesses and consumers more choice and control over how they interact with Google’s search services — as well as unlocking greater opportunities for innovation across the UK tech sector and broader economy,” Cardell said in a statement.</p><p>In response, Google <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/search-ai-features-controls/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> that it’s “exploring updates to let sites specifically opt out of Search generative AI features.” The aim, it said, is to keep search helpful for people who want information quickly while allowing publishers to better manage content. “Any new controls need to avoid breaking Search in a way that leads to a fragmented or confusing experience for people,” the company wrote, adding that it’s “optimistic” it can meet the CMA’s requirements.</p><p>When its new designation was announced in October 2025, Google complained that some of the proposed interventions would inhibit UK innovation and growth. Citing a study, the company <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/search/search-ai-features-controls/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that similar measures imposed by the European Union produced “negative results” that “have cost businesses $114 billion.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/uk-wants-to-give-web-publishers-a-fairer-deal-with-googles-ai-overviews-132742850.html?src=rss",

The key shift is that some of these apps are now subscription-only on iPad, even as Apple continues to offer one-time purchases on the Mac – albeit with slightly different feature offerings. Here’s everything you need to know about Apple Creator Studio and the programs it includes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-apple-creator-studio-includes\">What Apple Creator Studio includes</h2>\n<p>At its core, Apple Creator Studio gives subscribers access to Apple’s professional video, music and imaging apps. The <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-bundles-creative-apps-such-as-final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-into-a-single-subscription-145210038.html\" target=\"_blank\">bundle includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor and MainStage</a>. Pixelmator Pro (which <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-is-buying-the-developer-of-one-of-the-iphones-best-photo-editing-apps-165853866.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple acquired in late 2024</a>) is also coming to iPad for the first time, with a touch-optimized interface and Apple Pencil support.</p>\n<p>A Creator Studio subscription also unlocks premium content and features inside Apple’s productivity apps. Keynote, Pages and Numbers remain free, but subscribers get access to premium templates and themes, plus a new Content Hub with Apple-curated photos, graphics and illustrations. Similar paid features are coming to Freeform later this year, the company says.</p>\n<p>Apple is also using the bundle to introduce new “intelligence” features across several apps. In Final Cut Pro, the new Beat Detection feature can analyze a music track and show a beat grid so you can line edits up to the rhythm. The app is also getting tools like transcript search and visual search designed to make it easier to find moments across footage.</p>\n<p>Logic Pro is gaining new AI-assisted Session Players and workflow features on Mac and iPad. Pixelmator Pro continues to rely heavily on machine learning for tasks like background removal, image repair and image upscaling. Note that some of these features require an Apple Intelligence-capable device.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-which-devices-are-supported\">Which devices are supported</h2>\n<p>Apple Creator Studio works across multiple Apple platforms, though not every app is available everywhere.</p>\n<p>On the Mac, subscribers get access to all six apps: Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro, Pixelmator Pro, Motion, Compressor and MainStage.</p>\n<p>On the iPad, Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro are included. Motion, Compressor and MainStage remain Mac-only.</p>\n<p>On the iPhone, Creator Studio does not include full versions of Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro or Pixelmator Pro. Instead, it unlocks premium features and content inside Keynote, Pages and Numbers, and eventually Freeform.</p>\n<p>Apple says the best experience is on macOS 26, iPadOS 26 and iOS 26 or later, with individual app requirements varying by device and chip.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Apple Creator Studio apps\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Screenshot_2026-01-26_at_11.22.55%E2%80%AFAM.png\" style=\"height: 534px; width: 816px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Apple Creator Studio apps\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Apple\n </div>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-pricing-and-subscription-options\">Pricing and subscription options</h2>\n<p><a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=7ad37d82-e859-4466-9dbd-e68c114e5e43&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=Apple+Creator+Studio&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vYXBwbGUtY3JlYXRvci1zdHVkaW8vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3YWQzN2Q4Mi1lODU5LTQ0NjYtOWRiZC1lNjhjMTE0ZTVlNDMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9hcHBsZS1jcmVhdG9yLXN0dWRpby8ifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAVWmK3KQg8RtDiy8VsVY_rUQBjjhBZSSQdpaAneCMpdh&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-creator-studio%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Creator Studio</a> costs $12.99 per month or $129 per year, and new subscribers can try the service free for one month. College students and educators get a steep discount: the education plan costs $2.99 per month or $29.99 per year, and it also comes with a one-month free trial.</p>\n<p>A standard subscription can be shared with up to five other people using Family Sharing, allowing six users total. Education subscriptions are limited to individual use and cannot be shared. Apple is also offering three free months of Creator Studio to customers who purchase a qualifying new Mac or iPad around launch.</p>\n<p>But Creator Studio isn’t the only way you can access most of these apps. Apple says all of the major apps included in Creator Studio will continue to be available as one-time purchases on the Mac App Store.</p>\n<p>Final Cut Pro remains priced at $299.99, Logic Pro at $199.99, Pixelmator Pro at $49.99, Motion at $49.99, Compressor at $49.99 and MainStage at $29.99. Users who already own these apps can keep using them and re-download them from the App Store as usual.</p>\n<p>On the iPad, however, things are different. Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro for iPad are only available through the Creator Studio subscription. There is no standalone purchase option for those apps on iPadOS.</p>\n<p>Keynote, Pages, Numbers and Freeform remain free for everyone to download and use. Apple says those apps will continue receiving updates, including the upcoming visual design changes tied to iOS 26 and iPadOS 26.</p>\n<p>Without a Creator Studio subscription, you can still create, edit and collaborate in those apps. What you will not get are the paid templates, Content Hub assets and certain intelligence features.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-happens-to-your-projects-if-you-cancel\">What happens to your projects if you cancel</h2>\n<p>Apple says projects and content you create with an active subscription remain licensed as part of your original work.</p>\n<p>Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro and Pixelmator Pro projects remain on your devices and can be copied or shared elsewhere. But you will need an active subscription to open or edit projects in those paid apps.</p>\n<p>Keynote, Pages, Numbers and Freeform documents remain editable without a subscription. However, you will not be able to make new edits that rely on paid features once your subscription ends.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-information-about-the-new-bundle\">Other information about the new bundle</h2>\n<p>Apple Creator Studio also comes with some immediate trade-offs. Alongside the bundle, Apple confirmed that the older Pixelmator app for iPhone and iPad, now described as Pixelmator Classic, will no longer receive updates. Apple says it will remain functional, but development is shifting to Pixelmator Pro, including the new iPad version included with Creator Studio.</p>\n<p>But don't expect the standalone versions of the apps to maintain feature parity with their Creator Studio counterparts. Per <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=4130e2f0-a14f-4c5e-bdab-cd52ac7d8e79&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=7ad37d82-e859-4466-9dbd-e68c114e5e43&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Apple&amp;linkText=Apple%27s+FAQ&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hcHBsZS5jb20vcGl4ZWxtYXRvci1wcm8vIzp-OnRleHQ9V2hhdCUyMGlzJTIwdGhlLHRoZSUyMEFwcCVDMiVBMFN0b3JlIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI3YWQzN2Q4Mi1lODU5LTQ0NjYtOWRiZC1lNjhjMTE0ZTVlNDMiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwcGxlLmNvbS9waXhlbG1hdG9yLXByby8jOn46dGV4dD1XaGF0JTIwaXMlMjB0aGUsdGhlJTIwQXBwJUMyJUEwU3RvcmUifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAeaqbqxVQG6LJISNfywRbgzoQrTzhWj339COoM3gHhG_&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fpixelmator-pro%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DWhat%2520is%2520the%2Cthe%2520App%25C2%25A0Store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's FAQ</a>, &quot;The Apple Creator Studio version of Pixelmator Pro includes access to the Warp Tool feature,&quot; which implies that feature isn't present on the standalone version.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More broadly, the bundle puts Apple more directly in competition with Adobe and other subscription-focused creative platforms, especially for people who are looking for a lower monthly entry point. At the same time, Apple is keeping one-time purchases on the table for Mac users, even as iPad access moves behind a subscription.</p>\n<p>Apple Creator Studio will be available January 28. Whether it makes sense will likely come down to which device you work on and whether you would otherwise pay upfront for one or more of Apple’s pro apps.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-creator-studio-is-now-available-whats-included-how-much-it-costs-and-what-it-means-for-creators-130000182.html?src=rss",
