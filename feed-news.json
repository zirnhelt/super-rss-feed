Now, Mercedes follows Volkswagen in leaving Westfalia behind and pulling its small camper van production entirely in-house. So, more literally than any other vehicle on the planet, the newly updated 2026 Marco Polo is the Mercedes of RV life.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/2026-mercedes-marco-polo-camper-van/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/\">Campervans</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/adventure-vehicles/\">Adventure Vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/outdoors/\">Outdoors</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/mini-campervan/\" rel=\"tag\">mini-campervan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/campervan/\" rel=\"tag\">Campervan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/mercedes-benz/\" rel=\"tag\">Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/mercedes/\" rel=\"tag\">Mercedes</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/\" rel=\"tag\">RV</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/\" rel=\"tag\">Outdoors and Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/\" rel=\"tag\">Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/smart-rv/\" rel=\"tag\">smart RV</a></p>",

This is the hot new trend in air travel: pulling out all the stops to cater to the wealthy.</p>\n\t<p>Airlines are adding suites with more bed space, privacy doors, an extra ottoman for guests. They&#8217;re offering caviar, free PJs, luxury skin care products, and multi-course meals with wine pairings made by gourmet chefs. They&#8217;re also building more airport lounges. Meanwhile, economy is getting more cramped and low-cost carriers are going bankrupt. It&#8217;s because wealthy passengers are where the money&#8217;s at.</p>\n\t<p>For years, airlines have made more money from their credit cards than from actually flying passengers around.

The first of these will be a feature film written by Ben Mekler and Chris Amick. <em>Ticket to Ride </em>creator Alan R. Moon will serve as an executive producer on the project, which will be the game’s first on-screen adaptation. Exactly what it will look like is not yet clear, but the internet already has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1r78sau/netflix_developing_ticket_to_ride_movie/\"><ins>plenty</ins></a> of theories.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Ticket to Ride</em> is a train-themed turn-based strategy and route-building game first released over 20 years ago.

Some of the more interesting details about his campaign:</p>\n\t<ul>\n<li>If elected, he&#8217;d rename the White House to the Blues House.</li>\n\t<li>Running mate was slated to be Phyllis Diller. &#8220;She seems to have that sua-a-a-a-ve manner; she looks far into the future. She&#8217;s looking into the future. So I&#8217;m a future man, I said to her.&#8221;</li>\n\t<li>His nominees for a stacked cabinet: Duke Ellington (minister of foreign affairs), Charlie Mingus (minister of peace), Peggy Lee (minister of labor), Malcolm X (minister of justice), Louis Armstrong (minister of agriculture), Ray Charles (Librarian of Congress), and Miles Davis (head of the CIA). Of Davis, Gillespie said: &#8220;O-o-oh, honey, you know his schtick. He&#8217;s ready for that position. He&#8217;d know just what to do in that position.&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n\t<p>Gillespie dropped out before the election, paving the way for Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s victory over Barry Goldwater, who Gillespie said &#8220;wants to take us back to the horse­-and-buggy days when we are in the space age&#8221;.\n</p>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Dizzy%20Gillespie\">Dizzy Gillespie</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/music\">music</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a></p>",

They will also get priority replies and go ad-free on stories. Snapchat pitches the new feature as great way to give creators &quot;freedom to experiment&quot; and &quot;build a recurring income stream&quot; — all good things for keeping people on your platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Creators can choose exactly how much they want to charge subscribers per month.

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

EC officials are concerned about the sale of illegal products, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddrg70pj1mo\"><ins>child sexual abuse material</ins></a>, as well as the potentially addictive design of its shopping experience. The Commission found fellow low-cost retailer Temu <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1913\"><ins>in violation</ins></a> of the Digital Services Act after a similar investigation last year.</p>\n<p>The probe is being opened under the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act\"><ins>Digital Services Act</ins></a>, a set of EU rules governing online services. The Commission will examine how Shein drives engagement with shoppers, including using a points and rewards system, and whether the company is properly mitigating the risk of addiction via these and other features.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Algorithmic recommendation systems are another point of contention, and the Commission will ask Shein to disclose how it suggests  products to users. It also says that the company must offer users a system that is not based on profiling.</p>\n<p>The Singapore-based company has faced a great deal of scrutiny in past years on a number of fronts, including its labor practices, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg7n1d85go\"><ins>materials sourcing</ins></a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-temu-and-more-face-complaints-alleging-gdpr-violations-in-eu-195115567.html\"><ins>data practices</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/what-is-stake-china-founded-e-commerce-giant-shein-eu-rule-looms-2024-06-19/\"><ins>IP infringement</ins></a>.

Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has announced an <a href=\"https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-opens-investigation-x-xiuc\">inquiry into X</a> regarding the harmful, intimate images and processing of EU and EEA individuals' personal data — including children.</p>\n<p>In an 11-day period, X generated about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html\">three million sexualized images</a>, an estimated 23,000 of which were of children. British nonprofit, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) announced the <a href=\"https://counterhate.com/research/grok-floods-x-with-sexualized-images/\">results</a> of its December 29 to January 9 review last month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Critically, the investigation will determine whether X has broken GDPR laws. &quot;The DPC has been engaging with XIUC since media reports first emerged a number of weeks ago concerning the alleged ability of X users to prompt the @Grok account on X to generate sexualised images of real people, including children,&quot; DPC deputy commissioner Graham Doyle said, referring to X using the full title X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Doyle continued: &quot;As the Lead Supervisory Authority for XIUC across the EU/EEA, the DPC has commenced a large-scale inquiry which will examine XIUC’s compliance with some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand.&quot;</p>\n<p>The DPC's probe could have repercussions for X across the EU, while also building on similar probes in the bloc. In January, the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-eu-is-investigating-grok-and-x-over-potentially-illegal-deepfakes-134506678.html\">launched an investigation</a> into whether X has violated the Digital Services Act. It's looking into if X has properly &quot;assessed and mitigated&quot; Grok's risks on X, including the spread of illegal content such as the AI-generation nonconsensual sexually explicit images. Once again this includes those of children — this disturbing point can't be emphasized too much.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>X claimed in mid-January that it was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-says-grok-will-no-longer-edit-images-of-real-people-into-bikinis-231430257.html\">preventing Grok</a> from editing photos of real people to give them revealing clothing. However, this seems far from the truth. Earlier this month, a male reporter found Grok would still put him <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-which-maybe-stopped-undressing-women-without-their-consent-still-undresses-men-170750752.html\">in revealing clothing</a> and even added visible genitalia.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-launches-second-investigation-into-groks-nonconsensual-image-generation-113239967.html?src=rss",

That’s where noise-canceling headphones earn their keep. A good pair doesn’t just quiet the world around you, it creates a pocket of calm so you can actually enjoy your music, podcasts or peace and quiet.<br /><br />Modern noise-canceling headphones have come a long way, combining powerful ANC with clearer sound, longer battery life and smarter features like adaptive modes and multipoint connectivity. Some emphasize comfort for long flights, while others are tuned for audiophiles who want studio-level clarity.<br /><br />We’ve tested a wide range of options to find the best noise-canceling headphones for every listener. Whether you’re after something lightweight for travel or a premium set for focused work sessions, these picks deliver the sound, silence and comfort you need to tune out the chaos.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-noise-canceling-headphones-of-2026\">Best noise-canceling headphones of 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-\"></h2> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-noise-canceling-headphones-for-you\">How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>For gamers, there are also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html\">gaming headsets</a> that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.</p> \n<p>Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.</p> \n<p>Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-headphones\">How we test noise-canceling headphones</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.</p> \n<p>ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-noise-canceling-headphones-we-tested\">Other noise-canceling headphones we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-airpods-max\">AirPods Max</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326-143034684.html\">Apple’s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-dyson-on-trac\">Dyson On-Trac</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/dyson-ontrac-headphones-review-when-the-basics-arent-enough-151518312.html\">On-Trac headphones</a> have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sonos-ace\">Sonos Ace</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html\">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sony-ult-wear\">Sony ULT Wear</h3> \n<p>If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-ult-wear-headphones-review-brain-shaking-bass-160000739.html\">ULT Wear</a> is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-beats-studio-pro\">Beats Studio Pro</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html\">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-master--dynamic-mh40-2nd-gen\">Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html\">MH40</a> are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bowers--wilkins-px8\">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8</h3> \n<p>The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html\">Px8</a> is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-noble-audio-fokus-apollo\">Noble Audio FoKus Apollo</h3> \n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html\">this</a> is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">best wireless headphones</a>, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers &amp; Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-noise-canceling-headphones-faqs\">Noise-canceling headphones FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-block-all-noise\">Does noise cancellation block all noise?</h3> \n<p>Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-there-a-difference-between-wired-vs-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones\">Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?</h3> \n<p>In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-impact-sound-quality\">Does noise cancellation impact sound quality?</h3> \n<p>ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

Advances in active noise cancellation and audio processing mean today’s best earbuds do a much better job of cutting through background noise, without forcing you to move up to bulky over-ear headphones.<br /><br />The latest models also balance sound quality with convenience, offering stable Bluetooth connections, comfortable fits and battery life that can last through a full day with help from their charging cases. From premium options with the strongest ANC to more affordable picks that still get the basics right, there’s no shortage of solid choices depending on what you value most.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-noise-cancelling-earbuds-for-2026\">Best noise-cancelling earbuds for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-noise-canceling-earbuds-for-you\">How to choose the best noise-canceling earbuds for you</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>Most true wireless earbuds these days have a “traditional” design that’s a round bud that fits in your ear canals. However, there are some variations on the formula in terms of shape, size and additional fitting elements. Some companies include fins or fit wings to help hold their in-ear earbuds in place while others opt for an over-the-ear hook on more <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html\">sporty models</a>. You’ll want to pay attention to these things to make sure they align with how you plan to use them. Also consider overall size and weight since those two factors can impact the fit. A less-than-ideal seal due to a weird fit will affect the performance of active noise-canceling earbuds.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of earbuds offer. You’ll see terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>the outside of the device to detect ambient noise. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it’s at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups or ear tips. Adaptive ANC is also better at combating wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using earbuds outdoors. For this top pick list of the best noise-canceling earbuds, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise in noisy environments.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of earbuds offers presets or adjustable levels of noise reduction. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that either provide maximum noise-blocking or prioritize energy efficiency. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-earbuds\">How we test noise-canceling earbuds</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for ANC earbuds is typically 6-10 hours, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). When necessary, I’ll power the headphones off during a review without putting them back in the case. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to wear them for an entire day.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use the earbuds in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I also use them during air travel, since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I’m not slated to hop on a flight, I simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well earbuds block human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC setups.</p> \n<p>I also do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double-checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set, and revisit the closest competition as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-earbuds-150026857.html?src=rss",

The new chapter will include not only a game but a novel and music, the company said in a <a href=\"https://blooberteam.prowly.com/446859-layers-of-fear-3-revealed-bloober-team-is-expanding-its-horror-multiverse-with-new-games-and-cross-media-content\">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The developer revealed the new IP via a live-action teaser, with an actor reading lines from William Blake's poem, <em>The Sick Rose</em>. A painting then fell from the wall, and the actor then turned over an hourglass with red sand, with a tagline stating &quot;The door won't stay closed.&quot; No gameplay or other information like the release date was revealed.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>What Bloober did say, though, is that it would launch new <em>Layer of Fear</em> non-game content, including a novel by horror writer, poet and vocalist Marta Bijan. The company also announced that it would release the soundtracks for <em>Layer of Fear,</em> <em>The Medium</em> and <em>Cronos</em> both in digital and physical (CD and vinyl) editions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new title is likely to be eagerly anticipated given Bloober's form of late. The company recently released its <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cronos-the-new-dawn-seems-to-smush-dead-space-and-control-together-in-a-good-way-172611962.html\"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></a> and a new Switch 2 <em>Layers of Fear 2</em> version called <em>Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</em>. The original <em>Layers of Fear</em> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-25-layers-of-fear-valentines-day-love-horror.html\">came out back in 2016</a> and is considered one of the better horror titles of recent years, thanks to an expertly crafted narrative and psychedelic thrills and chills. The sequel moved to a creepy ocean liner and was equally well-received.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Feb. 16, 2026 at 3:06PM ET</strong>: The headline was updated with the correct game name.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/layers-of-3-revealed-via-a-mysterious-trailer-and-poem-153021903.html?src=rss",

The app lets you connect unlimited accounts, track spending and investments, set financial goals and share access with a partner, all across web, mobile and tablet apps.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Monarch Money is the kind of budgeting app that can feel a little overwhelming at first, especially when you’re setting up categories, rules and recurring transactions. There’s a bit of a learning curve, and some of the finer details are easier to manage on the web than in the mobile app. But once you’re past that initial setup, it starts to make a lot more sense and becomes a powerful tool for keeping tabs on your finances.</p>\n<p>Where Monarch Money really shines is in the level of detail it offers. It’s built for people who want a clear, structured view of their money, not just a running list of transactions. In the budgeting section, you can see budgets versus actual spending by category, along with forecasts by month or by year.

You don't even have to spend $500 today to get a decent handset, whether it’s a refurbished <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-iphone-160012979.html\">iPhone</a> or an affordable <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-android-phone-130030805.html\">Android phone</a>, as there are plenty of decent options as low as $160.<br /><br />However, navigating the budget phone market can be tricky; options that look good on paper may not be in practice, and some devices will end up costing you more when you consider many come with restrictive storage. While we spend most of our time reviewing <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-midrange-smartphone-183006463.html\">mid-</a> to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-smartphones-140004900.html\">high-end handsets</a> at Engadget, we've tested a number of the latest budget-friendly phones on the market to see cut it as the best cheap phones you can get right now.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-cheap-phones\">Best cheap phones</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-cheap-phone\">What to look for in a cheap phone</h2> \n<p>For this guide, our top picks cost between $100 and $300. Anything less and you might as well go buy a dumb phone instead. Since they’re meant to be more affordable than flagship phones and even midrange handsets, budget smartphones involve compromises; the cheaper a device, the lower your expectations around specs, performance and experience should be. For that reason, the best advice I can give is to spend as much as you can afford. In this price range, even $50 or $100 more can get you a dramatically better product.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Second, you should know what you want most from a phone. When buying a budget smartphone, you may need to sacrifice a decent main camera for long battery life, or trade a high-resolution display for a faster CPU. That’s just what comes with the territory, but knowing your priorities will make it easier to find the right phone.</p> \n<p>It’s also worth noting some features can be hard to find on cheaper handsets. For instance, you won’t need to search far for a device with all-day battery life — but if you want a phone with excellent camera quality, you’re better off shelling out for one of the recommendations in our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html\">midrange smartphone guide</a>, which all come in at $600 or less.</p> \n<p>Wireless charging and waterproofing also aren’t easy to find in this price range and forget about the fastest chipset. On the bright side, most of our recommendations come with headphone jacks, so you won’t need to buy <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html\">wireless headphones</a>.</p> \n<p>iOS is also off the table, since, following the discontinuation of the iPhone SE, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\">$599 iPhone 16e</a> is now the most affordable offering from Apple. That leaves Android as the only option in the under-$300 price range. Thankfully today, there’s little to complain about Google’s operating system – and you may even prefer it to iOS.</p> \n<p>Lastly, keep in mind most Android manufacturers typically offer far less robust software features and support for their budget devices. In some cases, your new phone may only receive one major software update and a year or two of security patches beyond that. That applies to the OnePlus and Motorola recommendations on our list.</p> \n<p>If you’d like to keep your phone for as long as possible, Samsung has the best software policy of any Android manufacturer in the budget space, offering at least <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/samsung-four-years-security-updates-152303907.html\"> four years of security updates</a> on all of its devices. Recently, it even began offering six years of support on the $200 A16 5G, which we recommend below. That said, if software support (or device longevity overall) is your main focus, consider spending a bit more on the $500 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-google-pixel-9a-might-be-the-new-midrange-smartphone-king-140021156.html\">Google Pixel 9a</a>, or even the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-8a-review-the-best-midrange-android-phone-gets-flagship-ai-features-140046032.html\">previous-gen Pixel 8a</a>, which has planned software updates through<a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-a-pixel-pixel-pro-pixel-fold\"> mid-2031</a>.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-phones-130017793.html?src=rss",
