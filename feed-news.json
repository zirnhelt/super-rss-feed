There are four available games to play, including <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n<p>These aren't new VR builds of the games, rather they are the versions previously released for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-26-nintendo-labo-review.html\">Nintendo Labo</a> VR set. This was a kit for the original Switch that allowed users to build a cardboard VR headset, among other items.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"cb0a072feed84ecc954d160d9d366b4f\"></div>\n<p>However, this is very good news for Switch 2 owners as Labo creations generally don't work with Nintendo's shiny new console. So this is the only way to experience the VR versions of the aforementioned four games. It's also worth noting that the Switch 2 upgrade for <em>Breath of the Wild</em> still includes the VR mode.</p>\n<p>There are some caveats. The Virtual Boy accessory is available to purchase as a hardware unit or in cardboard. The cardboard version is much cheaper, at $25, and is actually the preferred method for playing these games in VR.</p>\n<p>That's because the hardware version sits on a stand, like the original Virtual Boy, making it harder to move one's head around. The cardboard headset is free from those constraints. The hardware also includes red filters over the lenses, to better mimic the original experience, but these can be removed.</p>\n<p>However, the hardware version is better for playing actual Virtual Boy games, as they were designed for a static headset resting on a table. You'll have to decide if that trade-off is worth $100. It's also worth noting that Virtual Boy games <a href=\"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-clarifies-that-labo-vr-will-not-work-with-virtual-boy-for-switch-online\">will not work with the original Labo VR headset</a>, which is a bummer for OG Switch fans.</p>\n<div id=\"098320bb4af8469baa2f32343ef4b3c1\"></div>\n<p>Both versions of the Virtual Boy accessories <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-as-a-switch-and-switch-2-accessory-140037508.html\">will be available on February 17</a>, which is the same day several of the retro console's games head to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription service. They can be <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829\">purchased at the My Nintendo Store</a>. We got a chance to try the headset and came away fairly impressed, though noted that the revamped accessory is &quot;just as eccentric and ungainly as the original was three decades ago.&quot;</p>\n<p>For those wondering what all the fuss is about, the Virtual Boy was an actual console released by Nintendo all the way back in 1995. It was one of the first mass-market VR devices and, as such, was decades ahead of the curve. It was cumbersome, the games were only in red and there was nothing by way of motion control. Americans only got 14 games before the console was discontinued.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-virtual-boy-accessory-lets-you-play-vr-mario-and-zelda-on-switch-2-172138483.html?src=rss",

Its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $88 for two years, plus four additional free months. The Basic plan is where you'll see the biggest discount: it's $68 for two years, plus the same four additional free months.</p> \n<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best premium VPN</a>.

We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> \n<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-deal-two-year-plans-are-up-to-81-percent-off-right-now-180602064.html?src=rss",

But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day.

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

A four-pack of the first-gen Bluetooth trackers is on sale for $64, which is just about a record-low price (only $1 more). That's a 35 percent discount on the pack.</p> \n<p>Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag</a> down to about $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>If you use Apple devices and consider yourself to be a serial thing-misplacer, AirTags are extremely useful. Adding one to your account takes a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network so well established, locating missing items has never been easier.</p> \n<p>Using your iPhone you can trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively Precision Finding can be used to pinpoint its location via Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone, paying attention to the vibrations that signal you’re getting closer.</p> \n<p>A reminder again that the above deals apply to the first-generation AirTag only. Apple introduced a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\">tracker</a> with greater range and a louder speaker last month, which <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0GJTFXNRX&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e745850-e368-4111-83ab-157ddbe84ac4&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=retail&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmU3NDU4NTAtZTM2OC00MTExLTgzYWItMTU3ZGRiZTg0YWM0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaPN9LXQY-0xtODu-zAc_6biP338yFAO58xyoY7PRH7K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-AirTag-2nd-Generation-Precision%2Fdp%2FB0GJTFXNRX%2F\">retail</a>s at the same price as its predecessor.

The studio worked with Dutch video game developer Nixxes Software, which Sony acquired in 2021 to help bring PlayStation games to PCs. The sequel to the first <em>Death Stranding</em> is set in Australia almost a year after the events of the original game. It still features a post-apocalyptic world inhabited by strange creatures, and you’ll still control Sam Porter Bridges to connect survivors in the continent to the chiral network communications system. </p><p>Kojima Production says the PC version of the game will come with a bunch of improvements, will work with NVIDIA, AMD and Intel Upscaler and FrameGen, and will have uncapped framerates. It will support 4K gaming and will come with support for ultrawide monitors with 21:9 aspect ratio, as well as for super ultrawidescreen monitors with 32:9 aspect ratio for PC. When it comes to audio, the PC version of the game supports 3D audio via Dolby Access and DTS Sound Unbound, as well as Windows Sonic for headphones. You can play using a mouse and a keyboard if you wish, but you can also play with a DualSense controller.</p><p>You’ll be able to pre-purchase<em> Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> starting today for $70 on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-on-pc-march-19/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> or <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-7773ec\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games</a> and receive extra in-game items.

They’re quick to heat up, easy to use and well suited to everything from frozen snacks to roasted vegetables and simple desserts. For many people, they’ve replaced the oven for smaller meals, cutting down on cook time without adding extra cleanup.<br /><br />The category has also expanded well beyond basic basket-style models. Some air fryers are designed for small kitchens or single servings, while others offer larger capacities and preset cooking modes for roasting, reheating or dehydrating.

Whether you’re replacing an older unit or trying one for the first time, these picks focus on appliances that are easy to live with and deliver crisp food without the need for deep frying.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-air-fryers-for-2026\">Best air fryers for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-does-an-air-fryer-do\">What does an air fryer do?</h2> \n<p>Let’s clear one thing up first: it’s not frying. Not really. Air fryers are more like smaller convection bake ovens, ones that are often pod-shaped. Most work by combining a heating element and fan, which means the hot air can usually better crisp the outside of food than other methods. They often reach higher top temperatures than toaster ovens – which is part of the appeal.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>For most recipes, a thin layer of oil (usually sprayed) helps to replicate that fried look and feel better. However, it will rarely taste precisely like the deep-fried or pan frying version when it comes out of the air fryer basket. Don’t let that put you off, though, because the air fryer, in its many forms, combines some of the best parts of other cooking processes and brings them together into an energy-efficient way of air fryer cooking dinner. Or breakfast. Or lunch.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-buying-guide-for-air-fryers\">Buying guide for air fryers</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-convection-ovens\">Convection ovens</h3> \n<p>You can separate most of these machines into two types of air fryers, and each has different pros and cons. Convection ovens are usually ovens with air fryer functions and features. They might have higher temperature settings to ensure that food crisps and cooks more like actually fried food. Most convection ovens are larger than dedicated air fryers, defeating some of the purpose of those looking to shrink cooking appliance surface area. Still, they are often more versatile with multiple cooking functions, and most have finer controls for temperatures, timings and even fan speed.</p> \n<p>You may never need a built-in oven if you have a decent convection oven. They often have the volume to handle roasts, entire chickens or tray bakes, and simply cook more, capacity-wise, making them more versatile than the pod-shaped competition.</p> \n<p>The flip side of that is that you’ll need counter space in the kitchen to house them. It also means you can use traditional oven accessories, like baking trays or cake tins, that you might already own.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-pod-shaped-air-fryers\">Pod-shaped air fryers</h3> \n<p>Pod-shaped air fryers are what you imagine when you think “air fryer.” They look like a cool, space-age kitchen gadget, bigger than a kettle but smaller than a toaster oven. Many use a drawer to hold ingredients while cooking, usually a mesh sheet or a more solid, non-stick tray with holes to allow the hot air to circulate. With a few exceptions, most require you to open the drawer while things cook and flip or shake half-cooked items to ensure the even distribution of heat and airflow to everything.</p> \n<p>That’s one of a few caveats. This type of air fryer typically doesn't have a window to see how things are cooking (with only a few exceptions), so you’ll need to closely scrutinize things as they cook, opening the device to check progress. Basket-style air fryers also generally use less energy – there’s less space to heat – and many have parts that can be put directly into a dishwasher.</p> \n<p>Some of the larger pod-shaped air fryers offer two separate compartments, which is especially useful for anyone planning to cook an entire meal with the appliance. You could cook a couple of tasty chicken wings or tenders while simultaneously rustling up enough frozen fries or veggies for everyone. Naturally, those options take up more space, and they’re usually heavy enough to stop you from storing them in cupboards or shelves elsewhere.</p> \n<p>As mentioned earlier, you might have to buy extra things to make these pod fryers work the way you want them to. Some of the bigger manufacturers, like Philips and Ninja, offer convenient additions, but you’ll have to pay for them.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-03/fcbb58a0-a9d4-11ec-97f7-1be0d263a8a8\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-air-fryer-pros-and-cons\">Air fryer pros and cons</h2> \n<p>Beyond the strengths and weaknesses of individual models, air fryers are pretty easy to use from the outset. Most models come with a convenient cooking time booklet covering most of the major foods you’ll be air frying, so even beginners can master these machines.</p> \n<p>One of the early selling points is the ability to cook fries, wings, frozen foods and other delights with less fat than other methods like deep frying, which gets foods the crispiest. As air fryers work by circulating heated air, the trays and cooking plates have holes that can also let oil and fat drain out of meats, meaning less fat and crisper food when you finally plate things up. For most cooking situations, you will likely need to lightly spray food with vegetable oil. If you don’t, there’s the chance that things will burn or char. The oil will keep things moist on the surface, and we advise refreshing things with a dash of oil spray when you turn items during cooking.</p> \n<p>Most air fryers are easy to clean – especially in comparison to a shallow or deep fryer. We’ll get into cleaning guidance a little later.</p> \n<p>With a smaller space to heat, air fryers are generally more energy-efficient for cooking food than larger appliances like ovens. And if you don’t have an oven, air fryers are much more affordable – especially the pod options.</p> \n<p>There are, however, some drawbacks. While air fryers are easy enough to use, they take time to master. You will adjust cooking times for even the simplest types of food – like chicken nuggets, frozen French fries or brussels sprouts. If you’re the kind of person that loves to find inspiration from the internet, in our experience, you can pretty much throw their timings out of the window. There are a lot of air fryer options, and factors like how fast they heat and how well distributed that heat is can – and will – affect cooking.</p> \n<p>There’s also a space limitation to air fryers. This is not a TARDIS – there’s simply less space than most traditional ovens and many deep fat fryers. If you have a bigger family, you’ll probably want to go for a large capacity air fryer – possibly one that has multiple cooking areas. You also might want to consider a different kitchen appliance, like a multicooker, sous vide or slow cooker to meet your specific cooking needs.</p> \n<p>You may also struggle to cook many items through as the heat settings will cook the surface of dishes long before it’s cooked right through. If you’re planning to cook a whole chicken or a roast, please get a meat thermometer!</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-air-fryer-accessories\">Best air fryer accessories</h2> \n<p>Beyond official accessories from the manufacturer, try to pick up silicone-tipped tools. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B08RHQ5S95&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=8dfb0e35-0d59-41ac-a6cd-b9af5a4bdad8&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=Tongs&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NpbGljb25lLU5vbi1TdGljay1SZXNpc3RhbnQtR3JpbGxpbmctVG9ydGlsbGFzL2RwL0IwOFJIUTVTOTU_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiOGRmYjBlMzUtMGQ1OS00MWFjLWE2Y2QtYjlhZjVhNGJkYWQ4Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL1NpbGljb25lLU5vbi1TdGljay1SZXNpc3RhbnQtR3JpbGxpbmctVG9ydGlsbGFzL2RwL0IwOFJIUTVTOTUiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAUPuXbF4SKrJD7HqCUdz2gVav2-m2vB7sAFn3UNnuwHn&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSilicone-Non-Stick-Resistant-Grilling-Tortillas%2Fdp%2FB08RHQ5S95\">Tongs</a> are ideal, as is a silicon spatula to gently loosen food that might get stuck on the sides of the air fryer.

Yes, you could use power cleaners from the grocery store, they could damage the surface of your air fryer. Likewise, metal scourers or brushes could strip away the non-stick coating. Remember to unplug the device and let it cool completely.</p> \n<p>Remove the trays, baskets and everything else from inside. If the manufacturer says the parts are dishwasher safe – and you have a dishwasher – the job is pretty much done.</p> \n<p>Otherwise, hand wash each part in a mixture of warm water, with a splash of Dawn or another strong dish soap. Use a soft-bristled brush to pull away any crumbs, greasy deposits or bits of food stuck to any surfaces. Remember to rinse everything. Otherwise, your next batch of wings could have a mild Dawn aftertaste. Trust us.</p> \n<p>Take a microfiber cloth and tackle the outer parts and handles that might also get a little messy after repeated uses. This is especially useful for oven-style air fryers – use the cloth to wipe down the inner sides.</p> \n<p>If Dawn isn’t shifting oily stains, try mixing a small amount of baking soda with enough water to make a paste, and apply that so that it doesn’t seep into any electrical parts or the heating element. Leave it to work for a few seconds before using a damp cloth to pull any greasy spots away. Rinse out the cloth and wipe everything down again, and you should be ready for the next time you need to air fry.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-find-air-fryer-recipes\">How to find air fryer recipes</h2> \n<p>Beyond fries, nuggets and – a revelation – frozen gyoza, there are a few ways to find recipes for air-fried foods. First, we found that the air fryer instruction manuals often have cooking guides and recipe suggestions for you to test out in your new kitchen gadget. The good thing with these is that they were made for your air fryer model, meaning success should be all but guaranteed. They are often a little unimaginative, however.</p> \n<p>Many of the top recipe sites and portals have no shortage of air fryer recipes, and there’s no harm in googling your favorite cuisine and adding the words “air fryer” on the end of the search string. We’ve picked up some reliable options from <em>Delish</em>, which also has a handy air fryer time <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/cookware-reviews/a35686392/air-fryer-conversion/\">converter</a> for changing oven and traditional fryer recipes. <a href=\"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/air-fryer-recipes\"><em>BBC Good Food</em></a> is also worth browsing for some simple ideas, as is <a href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Nvb2tpbmcubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4ZGZiMGUzNS0wZDU5LTQxYWMtYTZjZC1iOWFmNWE0YmRhZDgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAQlYZaY4TNa78tVAt9mFUeOlSWHXXGjsrTSZXBwIMML9&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcooking.nytimes.com%2F\">NYT Cooking</a>, with the ability to directly search for air fryer suggestions. Aside from that, you can also grab plenty of cookbooks from your local bookshop with lots of recipes that you can use in your favorite air fryer.</p> \n<p>And if you have a killer recipe or unique use for your air fryer, let us know in the comments. What’s the air fryer equivalent of the Instant Pot cheesecake? We’re ready to try it.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-air-fryers\">How we test air fryers</h2> \n<p>We put each air fryer we test through its paces by cooking a variety of foods in it including raw proteins like fish and chicken, raw vegetables like potatoes and cauliflower and frozen snacks like mozzarella sticks. We attempt to use each cooking method that the machine has pre-programmed, and when possible, follow a couple of recipes in any provided recipe booklets that come with the air fryer. We also clean the cooking basket and all other removable components as many times as possible, and will put those components into a dishwasher if they claim to be dishwasher-safe. We also make note of how loud the machine is when using different cooking settings and how warm the surrounding area becomes.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/kitchen-tech/best-air-fryers-133047180.html?src=rss",

Now, at the tail end of that 20th anniversary celebration, Sony’s Santa Monica Studio has announced two new project. First, and most significantly, the original God of War trilogy from the PS2 and PS3 is being remade for the modern era. </p><p>There’s no footage of it yet — the developer says that they’re “very early in development,” so we likely won’t see or hear much about this for a while. But given renewed interest in God of War thanks to the excellent two Norse games from 2018 and 2022 (not to mention the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/tv-movies/ryan-hurst-cast-as-kratos-for-live-action-god-of-war-show-211655396.html\" target=\"_blank\">upcoming Amazon series</a>), it makes sense to revisit these classics. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>God of War</em> and <em>God of War II</em> were released for Playstation 2 in 2005 and 2007, respectively, while the third of the Greek trilogy hit PlayStation 3 in 2010. The third game was also remastered for the PS4. But it’s safe to say that while the first two games are classics for their era, they also really show their age in some gameplay spots. Hopefully the remake will smooth out those rough edges. (Who else has nightmares in the Hades level near the end of the first game? Not just me, right?)</p><p>While we won’t see the remakes for a while, there <em>is</em> a new God of War-inspired game out right now: <em>God of War Sons of Sparta</em>. It was developed by Mega Cat Studios, a developer known for its love of retro games — it even still releases games for the SNES and Genesis. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Given their pedigree, it’s no surprise that <em>Sons of Sparta</em> has vibes of classic 2D action/platformer games. It’s apparently canon for the series and takes place in Kratos’ youth while he trains with his brother. It obviously looks nothing like the other God of War games — but the combat and monsters shown off in the trailer definitely feel right at home in the series. </p><p>Perhaps the most fun part of all this is that it’s available today for $30. While <em>Sons of Sparta</em> looks like a fun curio for God of War fans, it’ll only go so far towards whetting our appetite for that remake series.

The bundle will feature 2008’s <em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, </em>the HD remaster of 2010’s <em>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker </em>and a selection of bonus content, including <em>Metal Gear: Ghost Babel</em>, which was originally released for Game Boy Color in 2000. All told, that’s a smaller selection of games than Konami made available with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-heads-to-consoles-and-pc-on-october-24th-170009937.html\" target=\"_blank\">Vol. 1</a> of the Master Collection, but Metal Gear fans will be excited nonetheless, if only for the fact it will mark the first time <em>MGS4</em> will be officially playable on a platform other than the PlayStation 3. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>That it has taken Konami nearly two decades to release the conclusion of Solid Snake’s story on more systems has to do with the nature of the game as a PS3 exclusive. <em>MGS4 </em>took extensive advantage of the console’s unique Cell architecture, a fact that made it difficult (and expensive) proposition to port to more recent x86-based systems. In recent years, it’s been possible to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQHZeCjVGIY\" target=\"_blank\">emulate the game on a powerful PC</a>, but not everyone has that kind of hardware.    </p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2  </em>will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p><strong>Update, February 12, 6:30PM ET: </strong>This story was updated after publish to add details about <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.2</em>’s launch platforms.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-next-metal-gear-solid-remaster-collection-arrives-this-summer-231711005.html?src=rss",

At today’s State of Play event, we got to see the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/new-gameplay-details-on-control-resonants-supernatural-action/\" target=\"_blank\">first extended bit of gameplay</a> from <em>Control Resonant</em> — and the combat looks as inspired as ever, though the setting is completely new.</p><p>As we learned in December, the next <em>Control</em> games doesn’t focus on Jesse Faden; instead, you’ll primarily play as her brother Dylan who Jesse was trying to find for much of the first game. Dylan’s out in a warped version of New York City trying to track the game’s Resonant creatures that are responsible for whatever calamity has taken place. We knew this already, but the change of setting from the Bureau of Control building into the more open city setting should go a long way towards making this game feel fresh. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Dylan’s capabilities are also completely different than what we saw from Jesse in the original. There’s a much bigger emphasis on melee combat, as Dylan has a shapeshifting weapon called the Aberrant. You can switch from hammer to blades to other various forms, much in the way that Jesse’s firearm in the first game could morph between different types of guns. </p><p>But the thing that stood out the most to me in the brief preview was the way that NYC completely disobeyed the laws of physics. Buildings and streets would just head into the sky at 90-degree angles —&nbsp;and Dylan’s powers let him completely which surface is the “ground” for him. </p><p>There’s still no firm release date for <em>Control Resonant</em>, but that’s not unreasonable —&nbsp;the game was only announced a few months ago. Remedy says they’re still on target to launch in 2026. And, at the end of today’s PlayStation blog post, they promise that “things are going to get weirder.” Just what I was hoping for!</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-first-control-resonant-gameplay-trailer-shows-dylan-defying-physics-in-a-sideways-nyc-224746545.html?src=rss",

It’s now slated to arrive sometime this spring. The developer initially planned to release the retro-style action-adventure platformer <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/mina-the-hollower-from-the-makers-of-shovel-knight-arrives-on-halloween-222539705.html\" target=\"_blank\">on Halloween last year</a>, but <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mina-the-hollower-from-the-makers-of-shovel-knight-has-been-delayed-222817866.html\" target=\"_blank\">delayed it</a> to “to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine.”</p><p>While <em>Mina the Hollower </em>didn’t make its original Halloween release date, at least the new demo, which will be available for a limited time, is getting a eerily timed debut. It’ll hit PS5 tomorrow i.e. Friday, February 13. Y’know… Friday the 13th?</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/mina-the-hollower-resurfaces-with-a-spring-2026-release-window-224327165.html?src=rss",

Based on a surprise trailer at Sony's latest <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-watch-playstations-hour-long-state-of-play-and-what-to-expect-162128585.html\" target=\"_blank\">State of Play</a>, it seems like its sequel, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12EQpTwn4lY\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Kena: Scars of Kosmora</em></a>, could up the ante when it launches later this year.</p><p><em>Scars of Kosmora</em> follows spirit guide Kena to a mysterious island called Kosmora, where a powerful spirit breaks her staff and forces her to embrace a new style of spirit guiding (and presumably a collection of new game mechanics). Like the first game, <em>Scars of Kosmora </em>looks to be filled with lush visuals and cute Spirit Companions, but also a surprising amount of boss battles.

As in <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, you’ll be able to play the mode with up to three other people online. Players can each choose from one of four classes — samurai, archer, mercenary and shinobi — who excel in different combat scenarios. All four classes can wield a katana and bow, but then they also have access to special weapons and skills. For example,  the samurai can wield the odachi, giving them a sweeping move set against groups of enemies.  You’ll need to use teamwork and your class’s abilities to take down demonic versions of the Yotei Six. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>The mode will arrive alongside the game’s 1.5 patch, and will be free for all <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>owners<em>. </em>At launch,<em> </em>players can look forward to three different mission types. In survival, you’ll be tasked with fighting off increasingly difficult enemies. In story mode, meanwhile, you and one other player will need to complete a series of 12 missions to unlock the expansion’s incursion mode, which will see you siege a fortress belonging to a member of Yotei Six. At first, there will be four strongholds for players to conquer, with a later April patch adding the final bosses. </p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/ghost-of-yoteis-multiplayer-expansion-arrives-march-10-223842684.html?src=rss",

Gail Slater, a former JD Vance adviser and Fox Corp VP, reportedly clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Their longstanding feud is said to have centered around Slater's skepticism of corporate mergers.</p><p>&quot;It is with great sadness and abiding hope that I leave my role as [Assistant Attorney General] for Antitrust today,&quot; Slater <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/gailaslater/status/2021975634445304262\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on X. &quot;It was indeed the honor of a lifetime to serve in this role.&quot;</p><p>Although Slater technically resigned, <em>The Guardian</em> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/12/us-antitrust-gail-slater-ousted-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that she was forced out. The fallout was said to be over her differences with Bondi (who just yesterday <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/pam-bondi-hearing-congress-democrats-epstein\" target=\"_blank\">yelled, insulted and deflected</a> her way through a hearing over the DOJ's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/09/jamie-raskin-doj-cover-up-epstein-files\" target=\"_blank\">stonewalling</a> of the Epstein files). In recent weeks, Bondi reportedly reiterated to the White House that Slater's views on the antitrust division's direction made the pair's relationship irreconcilable.</p><figure><img alt=\"WASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 11: U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi testifies before the House Judiciary Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on February 11, 2026 in Washington, DC.

She opposed the deal out of concerns that it would create a duopoly in cloud computing and wireless networking. In addition, Slater reportedly told Bondi that US intelligence hadn't raised any concerns about blocking the merger. However, CIA Director John Ratcliffe later <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/30/merger-hpe-juniper-networks-national-security\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> that blocking it would pose national security risks because it could lead to the loss of business to China. The Trump administration's merger-friendly DOJ ultimately approved the deal.</p><p>Alongside Bondi, Slater was overseeing the DOJ's review of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery</a>. In December, Trump said he would be involved in the regulatory review. That followed intense lobbying by Netflix and Paramount, the latter of which launched a hostile takeover bid. Earlier this month, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that the department was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/doj-is-investigating-if-netflix-used-anticompetitive-tactics-as-part-of-its-merger-probe-210940856.html\" target=\"_blank\">investigating whether Netflix was involved</a> in anticompetitive practices during the process.</p><p>Slater's ousting also comes weeks ahead of the DOJ's antitrust trial against Ticketmaster owner Live Nation. The department's lawsuit was filed during the Biden administration. It claims that Live Nation is operating as a monopoly, harming competition, fans, industry promoters and artists.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/antitrust-head-overseeing-netflix-warner-merger-resigns-192854114.html?src=rss",

This week, they made good on those threats.

The union Solidaires Informatique, which represents French workers from a number of companies in the video game sector, including Blizzard and Ubisoft, had previously <a href=\"https://x.com/SolInfoJeuVideo/status/1615263954955116546/photo/2\">called</a> for strikes to take place on January 27. Their demands included a 10 percent increase on all salaries and the implementation of a 4-day work week.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Some striking employees held up signs outside Ubisoft’s Paris headquarters, with one (pictured) wearing a Rabbids mask to hide their face. Their grievances are wide-ranging.

One employee who publicly voiced their disapproval of the new policy was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-fires-employee-who-publicly-criticized-its-rto-plan-220913747.html\">reportedly</a> fired for doing so.</p>\n<p>Ubisoft has had a rocky start to 2026 on the software side too. The long-awaited <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </em>remake was among six games <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-among-six-games-canceled-by-ubisoft-175801132.html\">canceled</a> by the struggling publisher last month, when it also confirmed several studio closures as part of the company’s organizational restructuring.</p>\n<p><strong>Update, Feb. 12 2026, 12:39PM ET:  </strong>&quot;We understand these changes, particularly those affecting work organization, are generating strong feelings,&quot; Ubisoft wrote in a statement shared with Engadget. &quot;Since the announcement, we have held a series of discussions and information sessions at multiple levels to help teams better understand the new organization and to give them the opportunity to share their questions and concerns.&quot; The company added that it &quot;remains committed to maintaining an open and constructive dialogue with employees and employee representatives.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/1200-ubisoft-workers-went-on-strike-in-response-to-company-restructuring-and-mandatory-return-to-work-policy-163714986.html?src=rss",

If I&#8217;m tired, it&#8217;s burnout. If I&#8217;m irritated, it&#8217;s dysregulation. If I don&#8217;t reply to a message immediately, I&#8217;m either protecting my boundaries or avoiding intimacy. I am never simply annoyed. I am always processing.</p>\n\t<p>To be fair, some of this shift was necessary. Therapy helps. Naming patterns helps. Talking about things publicly has helped people survive things they otherwise might not have. Awareness is progress. My awareness, however, has tipped into surveillance.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Being in therapy these last few years has been great, essential even. But I feel what Hussain is talking about here. One of the helpful things I&#8217;ve learned is that while you do need to change and grow, you still need to be yourself. I forget who, but someone once said that the job of an editor is to make a writer sound more like themselves. That&#8217;s probably true of the therapeutic process as well, including the part we&#8217;re responsible for.\n</p>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Sara%20Hussain\">Sara Hussain</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/therapy\">therapy</a></p>",

The sale applies to all three colorways.</p> \n<p>These easily topped our list of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">best wireless headphones</a>. They are, in a word, fantastic. The headphones are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html\">packed with premium features</a>, like advanced ANC. There are a whopping 12 ANC microphones throughout and a brand-new chip to power the feature. The end result? It successfully blocks background noise at medium and high frequencies, including the human voice.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction.</p> \n<p>The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The only real major nitpick here is the original asking price. It's tough to recommend any pair of headphones for $460, but a bit easier at under $400.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/our-favorite-wireless-headphones-are-down-to-a-record-low-price-175038190.html?src=rss",

New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That's $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> \n<p>We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-disney-hulu-bundle-is-down-to-only-10-for-one-month-192814350.html?src=rss",

While it's easy enough to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html\">replace the battery</a> in both versions of the AirTag, you may not want to have to rush to do so at the end of the battery's roughly two-year lifespan.

It's not the first time <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-extended-battery-airtag-case-is-down-to-only-16-162308748.html\">we've seen this deal</a>, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This is arguably one of the more useful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag accessories</a> around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> \n<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> \n<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-elevation-labs-10-year-extended-battery-case-for-airtag-for-only-16-for-presidents-day-151215232.html?src=rss",

Russian authorities removed the app from an online directory, effectively wiping it from Russia's internet. The government has previously said that it wants users to switch to an app called Max, an unencrypted WeChat clone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;Today the Russian government has attempted to fully block WhatsApp in an effort to drive users to a state-owned surveillance app,&quot; Meta told the <em>FT</em> in a statement. &quot;Trying to isolate over 100 million people from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Russian government deleted WhatsApp rival Telegram yesterday, while also erasing Meta apps Facebook and Instagram. YouTube access was also reportedly degraded, though it's not clear if the app has been completely removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In July 2025, a Russian lawmaker who regulates the IT industry said it's very likely that WhatsApp would be placed on a list of restricted software. Parent Meta has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/russian-court-bans-instagram-and-facebook-but-wont-kick-out-whatsapp-004629924.html\">designated as an extremist organization</a> in Russia, and last year Vladimir Putin issued a directive for the nation to further restrict communication apps originating from &quot;unfriendly countries&quot; that have sanctioned Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The state has said that an in-house app would protect citizens from fraud and terrorism, given the large number of scammers on WhatsApp in the nation. However, restrictions on Telegram haven't gone over well domestically, even among Putin's allies, as residents along Ukraine's borders have relied on it for drone and missile alerts. &quot;I am concerned that slowing Telegram could affect the flow of&nbsp;information, if the situation deteriorates,&quot; said the governor of one of those regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/whatsapp-is-now-fully-blocked-in-russia-110953485.html?src=rss",

The company has reportedly acquired the show’s IP and all rights from its original studio, Fifth Season, back in December in a deal that was worth approximately $70 million. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer, but Apple Studios will now be in charge of the show. <em>Severance</em> will be one of Apple’s marquee titles, alongside other shows like Owen Wilson’s <em>Stick</em> and Kristen Wiig’s <em>Palm Royale</em>. Apple also previously acquired sci-fi dystopian series <em>Silo</em> after its first season.</p><p><em>Deadline</em> reports that the show’s production costs were going beyond what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already asked Apple for advances in the past and was considering moving the production from New York to Canada for bigger tax rebates. Apple has also apparently been helping Fifth Season not just with its budget, but also with securing advertisers. </p><p>Seeing as the second season of <em>Severance</em> became the streamer’s <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/02/severance-ratings-season-2-apple-most-watched-series-1236294760/\" target=\"_blank\">most watched series</a>, and Apple definitely has the money to keep the show going, the company decided to take over the series completely. It will allow <em>Severance’s</em> production to stay in New York without having to worry about budget constraints. <em>Deadline</em> says the series is expected to have four seasons, with the spinoffs showrunner Dan Erickson and director Ben Stiller are open to now being in the realm of possibility. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-acquires-severance-and-will-produce-future-seasons-in-house-092405747.html?src=rss",
