As much as I love my 32-inch Alienware OLED gaming monitor, it doesn't do justice to Mafia's cinematic vistas of Sicily. <em>But</em>, I also wanted to play that game in its full 4K glory, with none of the compromises of today's game consoles. So why not just shove a tiny gaming desktop under my home theater? Enter <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.falcon-nw.com/desktops/fragbox\" target=\"_blank\">the Fragbox</a>, Falcon Northwest's revamped small form factor gaming PC. While it's very expensive, starting at $3,997, it's incredibly powerful and gives you the freedom to easily upgrade the hardware down the line.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I know what you're thinking: &quot;A $4,000 desktop, in this economy?&quot; That pricing also doesn't include upgrading from the stock NVIDIA's RTX 5070 GPU, as well as adding more RAM and larger SSDs, all of which could drive the price up thousands more. I initially planned to review the FragBox back in early December 2025, before the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/idc-warns-of-major-pc-market-downturn-due-to-memory-crunch-214510197.html\" target=\"_blank\">AI-induced RAMaggedon</a> made memory, storage and other components dramatically more expensive. Falcon Northwest is mainly known as a boutique and high-end system builder, so its wealthier clientele can likely weather the pricing storm. If you're looking for a deal, though, you won't find it here.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>So what, exactly, is a FragBox? Imagine a typical mid-tower desktop squashed down to a system that's only 10.2-inches tall, 10.5-inches wide and 15.9-inches deep. When Falcon initially debuted the FragBox in 2004, it was notable for being a genuinely small PC that used full-sized parts. That's still a main selling point today: It can still fit in large NVIDIA GPUs, including the beefy RTX 5090, as well as either Intel's latest Core Ultra chips or AMD's Ryzen 9000 CPUs. A huge 280mm radiator sits at the top pulling out hot air, and it also serves as an All-in-One (AIO) liquid cooler for the CPU.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At 25 pounds, the FragBox isn't exactly light, but its sturdy metal handle makes it easy to move around. Most mid-tower desktops usually weigh between 20 and 35 pounds, depending on their case material. But they're also much larger and harder to squeeze into tight spaces. The FragBox's relatively squat size makes it easy to shove into a home entertainment center, or just sit on the corner of your desk. I do wish the handle was removable, though. It was about half an inch too tall for one of my shelves.</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Falcon Northwest FragBox\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/falcon_northwest_fragbox_2.jpg\" style=\"height: 1493px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Falcon Northwest FragBox\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Devindra Hardawar for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>Despite its density, the FragBox's elegant design makes it a cinch to access to all of the system's components. Just unscrew the side and top panels and you can easily remove the GPU, RAM, storage and other major components. There are three slots of M.2 SSDs, as well as two locations for 2.5-inch drives and a spot for a large 3.5-inch HDD. The system is bundled with a 1,200W power supply, which should be more than enough to handle future GPUs and CPUs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ports are plentiful as well: There are two USB-A and one USB-C connections right up front, alongside a headphone jack. On the rear, you've got your typical assortment of mid-tower connections, including four USB-A 2.0 connections, seven USB-A 3 ports, one 20G USB-C 3.2 port, 2.5G Ethernet, HDMI and DisplayPort. Our RTX 5090 review unit also included three DisplayPort jacks and one HDMI connection (which you'll see on most GPUs). Wi-Fi 6E is also built-in, though at this price it would have been nice to see Wi-Fi 7.</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Falcon Northwest FragBox\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/falcon_northwest_fragbox_3.jpg\" style=\"height: 1514px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Falcon Northwest FragBox\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Devindra Hardawar for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>The FragBox, thankfully, lacks the garish LEDs and cheesy thermal glass you find on more ostentatious gaming rigs. Falcon Northwest's aluminum case looks and feels stately, like an old-school luxury car. If you want something flashier, you can shell out an additional $400 for a custom UV printed case or $149 for a UV-printed front panel.</p>\n<p>Our review unit was equipped with AMD's Ryzen 9950X3D CPU, NVIDIA's RTX 5090, 96GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2TB SSD. So sure, even before benchmarking or running any games, I expected it to be a beast. In PCMark 10, the FragBox scored a whopping 13,810, which is around 500 points higher than my mid-tower system with the same CPU and GPU. It also scored the highest 3DMark Speedway and Port Royal ray tracing scores I've ever seen. Even more impressive, the FragBox's fans were barely audible under load, and the CPU and GPU sat at a chill 52C and 65C, respectively</p>\n<table>\n <colgroup>\n  <col />\n  <col />\n  <col />\n  <col />\n </colgroup>\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233); vertical-align: top;\"><p>CPU</p></th>\n   <th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233); vertical-align: top;\"><p>GeekBench 6 CPU</p></th>\n   <th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233); vertical-align: top;\"><p>GeekBench 6 GPU</p></th>\n   <th colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px 0px 1px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233); vertical-align: top;\"><p>Cinebench 2024</p></th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Falcon Northwest FragBox</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>3,445/22,787</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>390,148</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>N/A</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>Desktop with AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D, RTX 5090</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>3,366/18,950</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>381,400</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>134/2,124</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>Desktop with AMD Ryzen 9 7900X, RTX 5090</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>2,822/14,216</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>358,253</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>113/1,103</p></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>Apple Mac Studio M4 Max</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>4,090/26,394</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>116,028</p></td>\n   <td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; border-color: rgb(224, 228, 233);\"><p>190/2066</p></td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>To get back to my initial point, it ran <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>in 4K flawlessly, with every graphics setting cranked all the way up. While playing on my 120-inch projector home theater setup, the game reached 62 fps natively, and flipping on DLSS upscaling and frame generation bumped that up to 120 fps. Not that you need a super higher framerate for a slow-paced, mostly cinematic action game. I was just happy to be playing without any compromises — even the PS5 Pro can't reach the same level of graphical fidelity as the monstrously powerful RTX 5090.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Falcon Northwest FragBox\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/falcon_northwest_fragbox_5.jpg\" style=\"height: 1532px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Falcon Northwest FragBox\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Devindra Hardawar for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>I'm no stranger to big-screen PC gaming, but previously I've had to run a laughably long HDMI cable from my desktop to make it work. I'm just too old for that mess now. And it also doesn't work consistently, especially at higher framerates, thanks to the massive bandwidth required to pump out 4K at high refresh rates. In-home game streaming is also an option, but that's not great when you're blowing games up to an enormous TV or projector screen. It's just too hard to ignore the imperfections of streaming compression. (Admittedly, I need to test newer high-bandwidth options, especially after I was impressed by <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nvidias-geforce-now-with-rtx-5080-gpus-is-a-cloud-gaming-revelation-130000231.html\" target=\"_blank\">NVIDIA's GeForce Now upgrade</a> last year.)</p>\n<p>The FragBox also made it easy to jump into all of my recent Steam titles, including <em>Mewgeneics</em> and <em>Arc Raiders </em>on a big screen<em>. </em>Unfortunately, Windows itself remains a key stumbling block for home theater PC gaming. You'll still need to keep a keyboard and PC around to deal with the initial OS configuration. And even once I enabled Steam's Big Picture mode, which offers excellent controller options, I still occasionally had to deal with Windows Updates and other annoyances.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Falcon Northwest FragBox\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/falcon_northwest_fragbox_6.jpg\" style=\"height: 1498px; width: 2500px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Falcon Northwest FragBox\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Devindra Hardawar for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>Microsoft is currently trying to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/lenovo-legion-go-2-review-the-utility-pc-gaming-handheld-120000533.html\" target=\"_blank\">optimize Windows for gaming handhelds</a>, and it's reportedly doing even more to make a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/2025-was-the-year-xbox-died-130000467.html\" target=\"_blank\">future PC-powered Xbox feel more console-like</a>. For now, though, using a Windows PC in your home theater doesn't feel much different than it did a decade ago. Steam is your savior, Windows is your enemy. Or you could just save thousands of dollars and buy a $500 PlayStation 5 or <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/playstation-5-pro-review-a-superpowered-700-console-for-gamers-who-wont-buy-a-pc-110056410.html\" target=\"_blank\">$700 PS5 Pro</a>, instead. The latter will still get you smooth framerates and a healthy dose of ray tracing, without the annoyance of Windows, keyboards and mice.</p>\n<p>But if you just want a compact and insanely powerful gaming desktop, and you don't mind spending a premium, it's hard to deny that the FragBox gets everything right.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/falcon-northwest-fragbox-review-a-compact-gaming-rig-that-does-everything-right-130000837.html?src=rss",

For everyday tasks like web browsing, writing documents, streaming video or handling schoolwork, a well-chosen budget machine can still deliver a smooth, reliable experience. The challenge is cutting through the noise to find affordable options that balance performance, build quality and battery life without serious compromises.<br /><br />For many buyers, timing is no longer optional. With Windows 10 support now officially over, upgrading has become a necessity rather than a nice-to-have. The picks below focus on cheap Windows laptops that can handle day-to-day workloads comfortably while keeping you current on software and security updates. If you’re open to spending more for extra power or premium features, our broader guide to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-windows-laptop-130018256.html\">best Windows laptops</a> covers higher-end alternatives as well.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-budget-friendly-windows-laptop\">What to look for in a budget-friendly Windows laptop</h2> \n<p>While you can do a lot even when spending little on a Windows laptop, you must set your expectations accordingly. The biggest downside when purchasing a budget laptop (of any kind, really) is limited power. You’ll want to carefully consider a few specs, the most important among them being the processor (CPU). Many Windows laptops under $500 run on Intel Celeron or Pentium chipsets, but you can find some with Core i3/i5 and AMD Ryzen 3/5 CPUs at the higher end of the price spectrum.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>We recommend getting the most powerful CPU you can afford because it will dictate how fast the computer will feel overall. Memory (RAM) is also important because, the more you have, the easier it will be for the laptop to manage things like a dozen browser tabs while you edit a Word document and stream music in the background.</p> \n<p>When it comes to storage, consider how much you want to save locally. If you primarily work in Google Docs or save most things in the cloud, you may not need a machine with a ton of onboard storage. Just remember that your digital space will also be taken up by apps, so it may be worth getting a little extra storage than you think you need if you know you’ll be downloading big programs. A final side note: solid state drives (SSDs) are ubiquitous at this point, not to mention faster and more efficient than hard drives (HDDs), so we recommend getting a laptop with that type of storage.</p> \n<p>As for screens, there’s a healthy mix of HD (720p resolution) and FHD (1080p) options in this price range and we recommend springing for a notebook with a 1080p display if you can. Touchscreens aren’t as common in the budget space as standard panels, but you’ll only really miss one if you get a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-best-2-in-1-laptops-for-2023-155052641.html\">2-in-1 laptop</a>.</p> \n<p>Before we get to our recommended specs for a cheap Windows laptop, it’s worth mentioning that Microsoft clearly lays out the true <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/windows-11-requirements\">minimum requirements for any Windows 11 machine</a>. Those include a 1GHz or faster processor that includes two or more cores, at least 4GB of RAM and 64GB of available storage space. That’s the bare minimum to run Windows 11; we recommend giving yourself some wiggle room by choosing a machine that will perform well now and for years to come.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-specs-to-look-for-in-an-affordable-windows-laptop\">Specs to look for in an affordable Windows laptop</h3> \n<ul> \n <li><p><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i3 or AMD Ryzen 3 processors, at minimum</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>RAM:</strong> At least 8GB</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Storage:</strong> At least 128GB SSD</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Screen:</strong> At least 1080p FHD</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>It’s essential to prioritize what’s important to you. But at the lower end of the budget, a good laptop may not offer everything you need, whereas a great one might. Although most machines come with features like Bluetooth, built-in Wi-Fi and additional ports, you might find not all of them come with the specifics you require, like an SD card slot, webcam, charger, and so on. Be sure to check the spec list of any laptop you’re considering before you buy, especially if you need specific connectors and capabilities.</p> \n<p><strong>See Also:</strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html\">Best Laptops for 2026</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html\">Best Gaming Laptops</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-2-in-1-laptops-173038508.html\">Best 2-in-1 Laptops for 2026</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html\">Best Chromebooks</a></p></li> \n <li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html\">Best Laptops for College Students</a></p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>As for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/microsoft-delivers-new-copilot-ai-pc-features-with-windows-11s-2024-update-140048807.html\">Copilot+</a>, don’t expect to see much of it on truly affordable Windows laptops just yet. Microsoft’s AI features and Copilot assistant require certain specs to run, namely a powerful neural processing unit (NPU), 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Currently, the cheapest Copilot+ AI PCs will run you about $700, so if you’re willing to pay more for those perks, check out our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-laptops-120008636.html\">best laptops</a> guide for more options.</p> \n<p>If you’re looking for either a gaming laptop or a “Windows on Arm” laptop, both categories will require you to spend more money than we’re discussing here.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-cheap-windows-laptops-for-2026\">Best cheap Windows laptops for 2026</h2> \n<p>The cheap Windows laptop market moves fast, and — unlike nearly all of our other buying guides — we haven't necessarily tested each specific configuration listed below. However, the combination of these technical specifications and familiar brands represent exactly the sort of entry-level laptops we'd recommend to shoppers in this price range based on our thorough research and expert knowledge.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-know-about-the-budget-windows-laptop-market\">What to know about the budget Windows laptop market</h2> \n<p>The best cheap laptop models change all the time. Unlike more expensive, flagship machines, these notebooks can be updated a couple times each year. That can make it hard to track down a specific model at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart or any other retailer. Also, we’ve seen prices vary widely depending on the configuration and retailer you’re looking at.</p> \n<p>You can ensure you’re getting a quality laptop by doing a few things. First and foremost, make sure you get a machine that follows the recommended specs we list above. Also, make sure you’re buying from a reputable retailer, including big-box stores like Walmart, Best Buy and Costco, online shops like Amazon or direct manufacturers like Dell, HP, Lenovo and others. If you have a physical store near you (likely a Best Buy in the US), it’s never a bad idea to go play around with some laptops in person before choosing one.</p> \n<p>If you decide to shop online from the likes of Amazon or Walmart, double check the seller of the laptop you’re considering. For example, many items on Amazon are “shipped and sold” by Amazon and those are typically the best options. You’ll see that information on Amazon on the right sidebar on a product page, under the Add to Cart and Buy Now buttons. Third-party sellers are common in the affordable laptop space. Amazon sometimes classifies laptop manufacturers as third-party sellers, so you may see a laptop shipped and sold by HP or Dell — that’s a good thing, since it’s coming directly from the manufacturer.</p> \n<p>However, there are other third-party electronics sellers out there. We recommend clicking on the third-party seller’s name on Amazon or Walmart (yes, Walmart has them, too) to see how much positive feedback and how many five-star ratings they’ve received from buyers.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-about-chromebooks-and-tablets\">What about Chromebooks and tablets?</h2> \n<p>You may be inclined to recommend a Chromebook or a tablet to anyone considering a budget Windows laptop computer. Those instincts aren’t wrong, but Chromebooks and tablets aren’t the best buy for everyone. Tablets have the most portability, but they will only work for the most mobile-competent users like kids who have been grabbing smartphones out of their parents’ hands since they’ve been dexterous enough to do so. Tablets can also be just as expensive as some of the cheapest Windows laptops, and that’s without a mouse or keyboard.</p> \n<p>Chromebooks are a good alternative for those that basically live in a browser, the trade-off being you must give up the “traditional desktop.” And Chrome OS is a more limited operating system than Windows when it comes to the programs you can install and run.</p> \n<figure>\n <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/843ff380-b255-11eb-bddf-b4000d3cf728\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-windows-laptops-do-well\">What Windows laptops do well</h2> \n<p>What can you realistically accomplish on a cheap Windows laptop? Quite a bit, especially if you’re doing one thing (or a limited number of things) at a time. They’re great for everyday tasks like web browsing, checking email, video streaming and more. All of those things can be done on Chromebooks as well, but Windows laptops have a big advantage in Microsoft Office. While yes, there is a browser based version, the native, desktop apps are considered a must have for many and will run smoothly on even the most bare-bones budget laptop. The only caveat is that you may run into some slowdown on low-powered devices if you’re multitasking or working with large data sets in Excel or a lot of photos and graphics in Powerpoint.</p> \n<p>When it comes to specs, a bright spot for Windows laptops is storage. Even the most affordable devices tend to have at least a 128GB solid state drive. That will come in handy if you prefer to keep your most important files saved locally on your laptop's hard drive. In contrast, cheaper Chromebooks often have less storage because they’re built on the assumption that you’ll save all of your documents in the cloud. Not only is that less convenient when you need to work offline, but it also limits the size of programs and files that you can download. So, Chromebooks aren't the best for hoarding Netflix shows before a long trip or for use as a gaming laptop.</p> \n<p>Windows also has thousands of apps that you can download from its app store. Chromebooks have some Chrome apps, numerous browser extensions and the ability to download Android apps, but quality control is… inconsistent. Android apps, in particular, often haven’t been optimized for Chrome OS, which makes for a wonky user experience. Windows may not have as many apps as Android, but at least the experience is fairly standard across the board.</p> \n<p>Windows also gives you the ability to download and use programs from other sources, like direct from the developer. You can run things like Adobe Creative Suite, certain VPNs and programs like GIMP, Audacity and ClipMate on a Windows device, which just isn’t possible on Chrome OS. Chromebooks limit you to the apps and programs in The Play Store and the Chrome Extensions store, reducing any others to unusable, space-sucking icons in your Downloads folder.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html?src=rss",

The good news is there are plenty of earbuds that play just as nicely with Android devices, and in some cases offer features AirPods simply don’t.<br /><br />From earbuds designed to pair especially well with Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel phones to models that prioritize strong noise cancellation, long battery life or workout-friendly durability, the Android ecosystem has no shortage of solid options. We’ve tested a wide range of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html\">wireless earbuds</a> to find the best picks for Android users, whether you’re after premium sound, reliable everyday performance or a more affordable alternative.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-android-earbuds-for-2026\">Best Android earbuds for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-wireless-earbuds-for-android-devices\">What to look for in wireless earbuds for Android devices</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"A selection of wireless earbuds sit organized in rows on a granite background.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-06/f9e8ef90-0c55-11ee-97db-1ddd4c19f474\" style=\"height: 1200px; width: 2000px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Jeff Dunn / Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>For the most part, the features you want from a set of “Android earbuds” are the same as what you want from any headphones. Great sound quality, a comfortable fit and sufficient battery life are still the foundations. Adequate water resistance is good for workouts, and nobody wants a crummy mic for making calls. Once you approach the $100 range, features like active noise cancellation (ANC), wireless charging, an ambient sound mode (which lets you better hear outside noise without turning off your music) and multipoint connectivity (the ability to pair with multiple devices simultaneously) should be expected.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>For Android devices specifically, there are a few extras to consider. A dedicated app that makes it easy to switch sound modes, customize the audio profile, locate your earbuds if they ever get misplaced or adjust other settings is strongly preferred. Features like <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/what-is-google-fast-pair/\">Google Fast Pair</a> or NFC-based pairing, which can help you avoid having to dig through your Bluetooth menu to connect your earbuds for the first time, are also nice perks. Some Android devices can also utilize higher-quality <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/from-mono-to-mainstream-20-years-of-bluetooth-audio-153031600.html\">Bluetooth codecs</a> such as <a href=\"https://www.aptx.com/aptx-adaptive\">aptX Adaptive</a> or Sony’s <a href=\"https://www.sony.net/Products/LDAC/\">LDAC</a> — these aren’t nearly as important to audio quality as the actual architecture of your earbuds, but they can help wring out a little more detail if the buds are capable enough and you’re streaming lossless files. AptX Adaptive can also help reduce latency, which is good for streaming video or gaming.</p> \n<p>Diversity is Android’s greatest strength, but it also means that some wireless earbuds play nicer with certain devices, typically those made by the same company. Recent Samsung earbuds, for instance, come with a few perks that are only available if you use a Galaxy phone. We have a couple of recommendations related to this idea above.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-android-earbuds\">How we test Android earbuds</h2> \n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Sony WF-1000XM5 review\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/ec3c38b3-2a1a-11ee-bbbf-4bc0ed25f859\" style=\"height: 1333px; width: 2000px;\" />\n <figcaption></figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Photo by Billy Steele/Engadget\n </div>\n</figure> \n<p>The best way to test earphones is simply to wear them as much as possible, so that’s what we do. We typically do this over a one- to two-week period, though embargo times occasionally force us to finish our review process a bit faster. We listen to a test playlist that includes several musical genres and podcasts, paying close attention to how each pair approaches the bass, mid and treble frequencies to get an accurate sense of its sound profile. We also test at high and low volumes to check for consistency in the tuning. We do not have access to a <a href=\"https://www.grasacoustics.com/products/head-torso-simulators-kemar\">dummy head</a> to take more objective measurements, but we’ll sometimes look to sites like <a href=\"https://www.rtings.com/headphones\"><em>Rtings</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.soundguys.com/\"><em>SoundGuys</em></a> and others that do just to ensure our impressions are not wildly off-base. If a model supports custom EQ, we’ll tinker with that and use the available EQ presets to see if one sounds dramatically better than the others — though in general we base most of our impressions on the stock tuning each pair uses by default.</p> \n<p>To assess microphone quality, we record our own audio samples and take multiple calls with a partner both indoors and outside. For battery life, we play our test playlist on a loop with the volume around 75 percent and measure how long it takes for each set to drain. Where applicable, we do a thorough review of a pair’s companion app and test each available feature. While comfort is ultimately subjective, we take note of how secure each pair feels while we’re on the move. We also use certain pairs in especially crowded public spaces to get a better sense of their passive and active noise cancellation, as well as their ability to maintain a consistent Bluetooth connection.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-recent-updates\">Recent updates</h2> \n<p><strong>February 2026:</strong> Updated to include new top picks.</p> \n<p><strong>November 2025</strong>: The lightly updated Beats Powerbeats Fit replace the older Beats Fit Pro as our top pick for working out. We’ve also noted the new Google Pixel Buds 2a as a cheaper alternative to the Pixel Buds Pro 2, which remain our recommendation for Pixel phone users.</p> \n<p><strong>August 2025</strong>: We’ve taken another sweep to ensure our advice is still up-to-date.</p> \n<p><strong>May 2025</strong>: We’ve checked this guide to ensure our top picks still stand and noted a couple alternatives to the Noble Fokus Rex5, since that pair has had stock issues of late. We’re also keeping an eye on how the Trump administration’s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/tag/tariffs/\">tariff policy</a> affects the pricing and stock of our recommendations (and the consumer tech industry as a whole). All of our picks are still available in their normal price ranges today, but we’ll update this guide if that changes.</p> \n<p><strong>February 2025</strong>: The Noble FoKus Rex5 is our new &quot;best for sound quality&quot; pick, replacing the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4. Our other recommendations remain unchanged.</p> \n<p><strong>December 2024</strong>: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and ensured that our current picks are still accurate.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-earbuds-for-android-devices-120015765.html?src=rss",

It's too early to say, but Volkswagen is giving those companies a leg up with its latest Multivan offering.

It's an empty shell built to spark the creative minds of the existing conversion establishment and upstarts of the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/volkswagen-multivan-camper-empty-base/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/\">Campervans</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/adventure-vehicles/\">Adventure Vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/outdoors/\">Outdoors</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/campervan/\" rel=\"tag\">Campervan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/volkswagen/\" rel=\"tag\">Volkswagen</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/\" rel=\"tag\">RV</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/hillside-leisure/\" rel=\"tag\">Hillside Leisure</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/\" rel=\"tag\">Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/\" rel=\"tag\">Outdoors and Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/phev/\" rel=\"tag\">PHEV</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/plug-in-hybrid/\" rel=\"tag\">Plug-in Hybrid</a></p>",

Earlier this week, the state's House Judiciary Committee voted in a 7-4 majority to pass the bill, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/HB26-1144\">HB26-1144</a>, along for a decision with the full House of Representatives. The proposed law would &quot;prohibit the use of a three-dimensional printer, or similar technology, to make a firearm or a firearm component.&quot;</p>\n<p><a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/manhattans-da-wants-to-know-why-youtube-is-pushing-ghost-gun-tutorials-to-kids-070219455.html\">Ghost guns</a> are typically made from 3D printers or similar machines without serial numbers, making them virtually impossible to trace and allowing users to skirt the federal requirements for purchasing a firearm. While the bill targets using a 3D printer to make guns, large-capacity magazines and other related components, it even bans possessing and distributing the instructions to manufacture guns in this way. However, these rules would be exempt for federally licensed firearm manufacturers.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>&quot;These ghost guns are increasingly found at crime scenes, making it harder for law enforcement to track down a suspect because the gun isn’t traceable,&quot; the bill's sponsor, Lindsay Gilchrist, said in a press release.</p>\n<p>Prior to this proposal, Colorado <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://coloradonewsline.com/briefs/colorado-bans-possession-creation-of-ghost-guns/\">passed a law</a> in 2023 that banned owning ghost guns or making frames for them. While SB23-279 laid the groundwork, HB26-1144 can be seen as the next step since it's much more encompassing by targeting ghost guns even before they're made. According to the bill, first-time violations will be treated as a misdemeanor, while repeat offenses will be upgraded to a felony charge. Looking ahead, HB26-1144 still has to secure a vote from both the Colorado Senate and House of Representatives before being delivered to the governor to be signed into law.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/colorado-is-working-on-a-bill-that-would-make-it-illegal-to-3d-print-firearms-and-gun-parts-211508169.html?src=rss",

According to <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-22/apple-s-ai-wearables-push-what-to-expect-from-march-4-low-end-macbook-launch\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s Mark Gurman, Apple is already mulling over what the next premium colorway will be for its iPhone Pro models. While we're not expecting iPhone 18 announcements until later this year, Gurman reported that &quot;red is the new flagship color in testing for the next iPhone Pros.&quot;</p>\n<p>Gurman added that there were rumors of purple and brown shades, but predicted that these could just be different shades of the main red option. Red is definitely a departure from Apple's usual palette of more modest tones, but the company could be trying to continue the momentum of its flashier Cosmic Orange option that has been boosting <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2d78d04-7368-4b0c-abd5-591c03774c46\">sales in China</a>. The bold orange option has been informally rebranded as Hermès orange among fans and is becoming somewhat of a status symbol in Chinese markets. With red as a potential frontrunner for the next iPhone Pro colors, Apple could capture even <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-smartphone-sales-china-plummet.html\">more sales in China</a>, especially since the color is seen as lucky in Chinese culture.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>It's not the first time Apple has offered red iPhones, though. Previously, Apple manufactured iPhones in deep red hues in collaboration with <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-gps-lte-product-red-edition-deal-amazon-123944170.html\">Product Red</a>, with the last available models being the iPhone SE, iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. On the other hand, Gurman reported that Apple will play it much safer when it comes to the rumored <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-will-reportedly-bring-back-touch-id-on-a-foldable-iphone-135831748.html\">foldable iPhone</a>, sticking with its basic tones.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-reportedly-considering-red-as-the-next-premium-color-for-its-iphones-185748052.html?src=rss",

According to <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-22/apple-s-ai-wearables-push-what-to-expect-from-march-4-low-end-macbook-launch\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>'s Mark Gurman, Apple will announce &quot;at least five products,&quot; starting on Monday, March 2, and extending to its scheduled &quot;experience&quot; on Wednesday, March 4.</p>\n<p>There's a long list of potential options that Apple could announce next month, but Gurman is confident in a few. According to the report, Apple is &quot;very likely&quot; to reveal the low-cost MacBook, especially considering the event logo's <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-may-be-adding-a-splash-of-color-to-its-upcoming-budget-friendly-macbook-192740002.html\">choice of colors</a> that could reference the new laptop colors. Gurman also predicted that Apple could announce the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-17e-will-reportedly-bring-some-key-upgrades-without-raising-the-price-174154577.html\">iPhone 17e</a>, since its predecessor was launched last spring, and an iPad Air that's updated with the M4 chip. Previous rumors point to Apple getting ready to drop the upgraded MacBook Pro, which will likely get M5 Pro and Max chips, and the new MacBook Air with the base M5 chip. If that wasn't enough, Apple could even debut the refreshed <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/apple-mac-studio-m4-max-review-a-creative-powerhouse-123000265.html\">Mac Studio</a> and a new Apple Studio Display since the two desktop-oriented options were already expected to be released in the first half of the year.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>There hasn't been any confirmation from Apple directly, but it may have left behind some hints for this &quot;three-day blitz&quot; of product announcements. Going off Apple's wording, the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/heres-what-to-expect-at-apples-product-launch-event-on-march-4-173612772.html\">March 4 event</a> will be an &quot;Apple Experience&quot; with locations in New York, London and Shanghai, which doesn't sound like the typical format of an event with keynote addresses that's paired with a livestream. Gurman also noted that Apple usually announces its new products on Tuesday, unlike the official Wednesday timing.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/apples-first-event-of-the-year-will-reportedly-bring-at-least-five-products-over-a-three-day-blitz-175017716.html?src=rss",

With recent versions of iOS, Apple has expanded those capabilities to include sending and receiving messages via satellite. This makes it possible to stay in touch with friends and family from remote locations where traditional networks do not reach, such as hiking trails, rural areas or offshore locations.</p><p>Messaging via satellite is built directly into the iPhone and works automatically when no cellular or Wi-Fi signal is available. While it is not intended to replace regular messaging, it can be a useful backup when coverage drops.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-send-a-message-via-satellite\"><strong>How to send a message via satellite</strong></h2><p>Before you can get started, you’ll need to turn on <strong>iMessage</strong> before you’re off the grid.

The feature is supported on iPhone models with satellite hardware, beginning with iPhone 14 and later. The device must be running a version of iOS (<a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0cf8bae0-8869-4c98-830a-b2eebb48d4bf&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=iOS+18+or+higher&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzLzEyMDkzMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGNmOGJhZTAtODg2OS00Yzk4LTgzMGEtYjJlZWJiNDhkNGJmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzLzEyMDkzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVawW2OetIgztQH6ZCmrWu9f6HIHY9uITW7D05T6sali&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2F120930\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 18 or higher</a>) that supports satellite messaging, which Apple has continued to refine through recent iOS updates.</p><p>The feature also depends on location and availability. Satellite messaging is currently supported in select regions, including the United States and parts of Canada, with expanded support rolling out gradually. The iPhone must be outdoors with a clear view of the sky, as trees, buildings and terrain can interfere with the satellite connection.</p><p>Satellite messaging is not designed for continuous conversations. Messages are compressed and sent at a slower pace than standard texts, and delivery times can vary depending on conditions and satellite positioning.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-satellite-messaging-works-on-iphone\"><strong>How satellite messaging works on iPhone</strong></h2><p>When an iPhone loses access to cellular and Wi-Fi networks, the system automatically detects that only satellite connectivity is available. Instead of failing to send, the Messages app prompts the user to connect to a satellite.</p><p>On-screen instructions guide the user to position the phone correctly. This typically involves holding the device up and following directional prompts to align it with an overhead satellite. The phone uses built-in sensors to help maintain the connection while the message is being sent.</p><p>Messages sent via satellite are text-only and use a reduced data format to ensure they can be transmitted reliably. Images, videos, audio messages and large attachments are not supported.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-who-can-receive-satellite-messages\"><strong>Who can receive satellite messages?</strong></h2><p>Satellite messages can be sent to contacts using iMessage or standard SMS, depending on the recipient’s device and settings. If the recipient is using an Apple device with iMessage enabled, the message will be delivered through Apple’s messaging system. If not, the message will be sent as a standard text.</p><p>Recipients do not need a satellite-capable device to receive messages. From their perspective, the message appears similar to a regular text, though delivery times may be longer.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-tips-for-getting-a-reliable-connection\"><strong>Tips for getting a reliable connection</strong></h2><p>A clear view of the sky is essential for satellite messaging to work properly. Open areas with minimal obstructions offer the best results. Movement, heavy foliage and nearby structures can interrupt the connection.</p><p>Because satellite bandwidth is limited, keeping messages short improves reliability and delivery speed. The iPhone may prompt the user to edit longer messages to fit within satellite constraints.</p><p>Battery life is also a consideration. Maintaining a satellite connection uses more power than standard messaging, so it helps to conserve battery when relying on satellite features for extended periods.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-limitations-to-keep-in-mind\"><strong>Limitations to keep in mind</strong></h2><p>Satellite messaging is designed for occasional use when other networks are unavailable. It does not support group messages, media attachments or read receipts in the same way as standard messaging.</p><p>Delivery times can range from under a minute to several minutes, depending on environmental conditions and satellite availability. The feature should not be relied upon for time-sensitive communication unless no other option is available.</p><p>Apple has also noted that satellite features may be offered free for a limited period, with potential pricing or subscription requirements introduced in the future depending on region and carrier arrangements.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-satellite-messaging-can-be-useful\"><strong>When satellite messaging can be useful</strong></h2><p>Messaging via satellite can be helpful for travelers, hikers and anyone spending time in remote areas where coverage is unreliable. It offers a way to check in, share basic updates or request non-emergency assistance when traditional networks are unavailable.</p><p>While it is not a replacement for emergency services, it complements Apple’s existing emergency satellite features by providing an additional communication option when users are off the grid.</p><p>As Apple continues to expand satellite support, messaging via satellite is likely to become a more familiar part of the iPhone experience, particularly for users who regularly venture beyond the reach of cellular networks.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-send-a-message-via-satellite-on-iphone-130000418.html?src=rss",
