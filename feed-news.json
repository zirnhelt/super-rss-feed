Gail Slater, a former JD Vance adviser and Fox Corp VP, reportedly clashed with Attorney General Pam Bondi. Their longstanding feud is said to have centered around Slater's skepticism of corporate mergers.</p><p>&quot;It is with great sadness and abiding hope that I leave my role as [Assistant Attorney General] for Antitrust today,&quot; Slater <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/gailaslater/status/2021975634445304262\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on X. &quot;It was indeed the honor of a lifetime to serve in this role.&quot;</p><p>Although Slater technically resigned, <em>The Guardian</em> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/12/us-antitrust-gail-slater-ousted-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that she was forced out. The fallout was said to be over her differences with Bondi (who just yesterday <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/11/pam-bondi-hearing-congress-democrats-epstein\" target=\"_blank\">yelled, insulted and deflected</a> her way through a hearing over the DOJ's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/09/jamie-raskin-doj-cover-up-epstein-files\" target=\"_blank\">stonewalling</a> of the Epstein files).

She opposed the deal out of concerns that it would create a duopoly in cloud computing and wireless networking. In addition, Slater reportedly told Bondi that US intelligence hadn't raised any concerns about blocking the merger. However, CIA Director John Ratcliffe later <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/07/30/merger-hpe-juniper-networks-national-security\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> that blocking it would pose national security risks because it could lead to the loss of business to China. The Trump administration's merger-friendly DOJ ultimately approved the deal.</p><p>Alongside Bondi, Slater was overseeing the DOJ's review of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-120836295.html\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery</a>. In December, Trump said he would be involved in the regulatory review. That followed intense lobbying by Netflix and Paramount, the latter of which launched a hostile takeover bid. Earlier this month, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that the department was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/doj-is-investigating-if-netflix-used-anticompetitive-tactics-as-part-of-its-merger-probe-210940856.html\" target=\"_blank\">investigating whether Netflix was involved</a> in anticompetitive practices during the process.</p><p>Slater's ousting also comes weeks ahead of the DOJ's antitrust trial against Ticketmaster owner Live Nation. The department's lawsuit was filed during the Biden administration. It claims that Live Nation is operating as a monopoly, harming competition, fans, industry promoters and artists.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/antitrust-head-overseeing-netflix-warner-merger-resigns-192854114.html?src=rss",

The sale applies to all three colorways.</p> \n<p>These easily topped our list of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">best wireless headphones</a>. They are, in a word, fantastic. The headphones are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html\">packed with premium features</a>, like advanced ANC. There are a whopping 12 ANC microphones throughout and a brand-new chip to power the feature. The end result? It successfully blocks background noise at medium and high frequencies, including the human voice.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction.</p> \n<p>The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The only real major nitpick here is the original asking price. It's tough to recommend any pair of headphones for $460, but a bit easier at under $400.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/our-favorite-wireless-headphones-are-down-to-a-record-low-price-175038190.html?src=rss",

Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That's $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> \n<p>We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-disney-hulu-bundle-is-down-to-only-10-for-one-month-192814350.html?src=rss",

While it's easy enough to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html\">replace the battery</a> in both versions of the AirTag, you may not want to have to rush to do so at the end of the battery's roughly two-year lifespan.

It's not the first time <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-extended-battery-airtag-case-is-down-to-only-16-162308748.html\">we've seen this deal</a>, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This is arguably one of the more useful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag accessories</a> around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> \n<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> \n<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-elevation-labs-10-year-extended-battery-case-for-airtag-for-only-16-for-presidents-day-151215232.html?src=rss",

Russian authorities removed the app from an online directory, effectively wiping it from Russia's internet. The government has previously said that it wants users to switch to an app called Max, an unencrypted WeChat clone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;Today the Russian government has attempted to fully block WhatsApp in an effort to drive users to a state-owned surveillance app,&quot; Meta told the <em>FT</em> in a statement. &quot;Trying to isolate over 100 million people from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The Russian government deleted WhatsApp rival Telegram yesterday, while also erasing Meta apps Facebook and Instagram. YouTube access was also reportedly degraded, though it's not clear if the app has been completely removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In July 2025, a Russian lawmaker who regulates the IT industry said it's very likely that WhatsApp would be placed on a list of restricted software. Parent Meta has been <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/russian-court-bans-instagram-and-facebook-but-wont-kick-out-whatsapp-004629924.html\">designated as an extremist organization</a> in Russia, and last year Vladimir Putin issued a directive for the nation to further restrict communication apps originating from &quot;unfriendly countries&quot; that have sanctioned Russia.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The state has said that an in-house app would protect citizens from fraud and terrorism, given the large number of scammers on WhatsApp in the nation. However, restrictions on Telegram haven't gone over well domestically, even among Putin's allies, as residents along Ukraine's borders have relied on it for drone and missile alerts. &quot;I am concerned that slowing Telegram could affect the flow of&nbsp;information, if the situation deteriorates,&quot; said the governor of one of those regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/whatsapp-is-now-fully-blocked-in-russia-110953485.html?src=rss",

The company has reportedly acquired the show’s IP and all rights from its original studio, Fifth Season, back in December in a deal that was worth approximately $70 million. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer, but Apple Studios will now be in charge of the show. <em>Severance</em> will be one of Apple’s marquee titles, alongside other shows like Owen Wilson’s <em>Stick</em> and Kristen Wiig’s <em>Palm Royale</em>. Apple also previously acquired sci-fi dystopian series <em>Silo</em> after its first season.</p><p><em>Deadline</em> reports that the show’s production costs were going beyond what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already asked Apple for advances in the past and was considering moving the production from New York to Canada for bigger tax rebates. Apple has also apparently been helping Fifth Season not just with its budget, but also with securing advertisers. </p><p>Seeing as the second season of <em>Severance</em> became the streamer’s <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/02/severance-ratings-season-2-apple-most-watched-series-1236294760/\" target=\"_blank\">most watched series</a>, and Apple definitely has the money to keep the show going, the company decided to take over the series completely. It will allow <em>Severance’s</em> production to stay in New York without having to worry about budget constraints. <em>Deadline</em> says the series is expected to have four seasons, with the spinoffs showrunner Dan Erickson and director Ben Stiller are open to now being in the realm of possibility. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-acquires-severance-and-will-produce-future-seasons-in-house-092405747.html?src=rss",

I took a couple of days off at the beginning of the week to visit some colleges with my daughter. She found a potential contender, one that was just fine, and a school that isn&#8217;t going to work for her — we both independently zoned out listening to the presentation about 10 minutes in. 😂 It was a last-minute trip and I&#8217;m so glad we got to go do this together. Standout food of the trip was from <a href=\"https://www.allanticovinaiousa.com/boston/\">All&#8217;Antico Vinaio</a> — best sandwich I&#8217;ve had in months. Anyway, I&#8217;m back now and focused on the site because what else is there to do when it&#8217;s -5° outside?\n\nSome of you have noticed that the comments have been turned off for the last few weeks. There was a rise in casual negativity that felt too close to how social media feels, i.e. a place where even well-meaning folks are not incentivized to think &#8220;this isn&#8217;t for me&#8221; and move on without comment. I understand that the pull of treating this social space just like other social spaces is strong, but we&#8217;re trying to do something different here, as outlined in <a href=\"https://kottke.org/threads/guidelines\">the community guidelines</a>. So, I took comments offline to regroup. They will be back soon; I miss them. Thanks for your patience.\n\nI have been busy the last couple of months and have lots of things in the pipeline, including a new t-shirt (and store), new site features, and a bunch of behind-the-scenes things that (hopefully) you won&#8217;t even notice. I&#8217;ve been kinda stuck on finishing them up and rolling them out because of <em>*waves hands around wildly at all the things happening in the world*</em> — it feels like a tough time to be anything but laser-focused on fascism, even though that&#8217;s what they want.\n\nThe bastards, they&#8217;ve ground me down some, I can&#8217;t lie. Striking any sort of balance between normalcy and alarm, personally, has been challenging. Hardly a unique situation — everyone I talk to these days is in the same boat to some degree (and some are in more challenging & dangerous boats) — and sometimes that solidarity is a comfort but sometimes it ain&#8217;t and I just feel stuck and aimless and wrong for not caring or for caring too much. But I&#8217;ll figure it out — we all will. I hope. ✌️ \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/kottke.org\">kottke.org</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/travel\">travel</a></p>",

But it's still a phone, arguably your most used device on a daily basis, so you may need to top it up during the day if you're using it constantly. That’s where Apple’s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFH9BST&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b81fb587-99ff-4a0a-8491-b9b9460d3e9a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=iPhone+Air+MagSafe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjgxZmI1ODctOTlmZi00YTBhLTg0OTEtYjliOTQ2MGQzZTlhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1QiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR9o3Bk1eGEoY_MpvpdVaX8WwrXHv-kJY6NrXwaRfhTy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFH9BST\">iPhone Air MagSafe</a> battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

And if you're like me, that alone is probably enough to sell you on the game. However, after getting a chance to play a preview of it for around half an hour, it became immediately clear that the game's coziness levels are off the charts, but it also offers some fun twists on the genre.</p><p>Co-developed by The Pokémon Company, GAME FREAK and KOEI TECMO, instead of playing as a generic trainer, you take control of a lonely <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ditto_(Pok%C3%A9mon)\" target=\"_blank\">Ditto</a> who wakes up in a cave only to be greeted by <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Professor_Tangrowth\" target=\"_blank\">Professor Tangrowth</a>, the last surviving inhabitant of what used to be a bustling town. While the professor might look like an extra-large version of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tangrowth_(Pok%C3%A9mon)\" target=\"_blank\">the original pokémon</a> with glasses, its role is to guide you as you rebuild and hopefully repopulate the surrounding area.</p><figure><img alt=\"One of the best things about Pokopia is actually being able to talk to the other 'mons.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Pok%C3%A9mon_Pokopia_Media_Preview_Screenshot_1_EN.png\" style=\"height: 2160px; width: 3840px;\" /><figcaption>One of the best things about Pokopia is actually being able to talk to the other 'mons.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nintendo</div></figure><p>As a Ditto, you naturally have the ability to transform into other Pokémon, though the process is sort of incomplete, meaning you can only learn one skill from the monsters you befriend instead of their entire moveset like in the mainline games. This is where the first twist on the traditional life sim comes in. Instead of crafting them or earning money to buy tools, you can transform into other Pokémon (like Lapras or Dragonite) to use their abilities to traverse obstacles or shape the world around you. For example, turning into a Squirtle lets you shoot a water gun that will revitalize dry patches or thirsty plants, while transforming into a Scyther lets you slice through objects similar to the HM Cut.&nbsp;</p><p>From there, you can use these skills to do things like create clusters of shrubs that will serve as homes for other Pokémon, allowing you to entice fellow creatures to return to the once desolate landscape. Another twist I really appreciate is that after appearing, new monsters will give you quests or just hang out. They will even talk and respond, and I don't mean like the 8-bit cries from other Pokémon games. They speak in full sentences, which is a wonderful departure from previous titles that really gives you the feeling that you're making friends and rebuilding a community instead of just being on a crusade to catch them all.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>The Stardew Valley part of the equation comes into play after you leave the first tutorial area and you come upon an abandoned Pokémon Center that's in dire need of a renovation. You can do things like collect materials and do more quests to clean up the area to eventually turn the building in the heart of the town. Unfortunately, that's where my preview ended, aside from quickly hopping into a multiplayer session where I was able to see a much more developed village, complete with multiple buildings, roads and benches. You know, all the sorts of things you used to furnish and decorate your island with in Animal Crossing.&nbsp;</p><p>This gave me a nice glimpse at just how many things you can build in <em>Pokopia</em> and how easy it is to visit other people's towns. However, it didn't answer some of my bigger questions about the game, like what's the deal with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Peakychu\" target=\"_blank\">Peakychu</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mosslax\" target=\"_blank\">Mosslax</a>, whom we've seen before in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://youtu.be/i-BOgDkTpD4?t=582\" target=\"_blank\">previous trailers</a>. Are they just one-off versions of existing ‘mons with unusual typings (i.e. ghost and grass) only for this game, or are they going to be a bigger part of the Pokémon world going forward? Perhaps more importantly, it was hard to tell if there will be any sort of PVE content like The Mines or Skull Cavern in <em>Stardew Valley</em>. I'm really hoping there is because it seems like Ditto's abilities could translate quite seamlessly to spelunking or battling your way through dungeons in search of rare items or building materials.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"I love how derpy Ditto looks when it transforms into other Pok&#xe9;mon. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Pok%C3%A9mon_Pokopia_Media_Preview_Screenshot_9_EN.png\" style=\"height: 2160px; width: 3840px;\" /><figcaption>I love how derpy Ditto looks when it transforms into other Pokémon. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nintendo</div></figure><p>That said, just being able to build a community of friendly monsters while injecting life back into a forgotten town has good vibes radiating from every corner. So if you need a super cozy game to keep you busy this winter/spring, <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> is shaping up to be the digital version of a fluffy blanket and a cup of hot chocolate filled to the brim with all of your favorite 'mons.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em> is available for <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-pokopia-switch-2/?srsltid=AfmBOoq45wYUuMnT6pZNiomOHLDMcZM12roLsGhKlGi5nUo24TX4Iual\" target=\"_blank\">pre-order now</a>, with official sales slated for March 5.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-is-so-damn-cozy-140000954.html?src=rss",
