In reality, European countries have achieved unprecedented levels of prosperity and social well-being, largely due to collective investments in health, education and public infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>To win the cultural and intellectual battle, Europe must now assert its values and defend its model of development, fundamentally opposed to the nationalist-extractivist model championed by Donald Trump&#8217;s supporters in the United States and by Vladimir Putin&#8217;s allies in Russia. A crucial issue in this fight is the choice of indicators used to measure human progress.</p></blockquote>\n\nFor these indicators, Piketty mentions some of the same factors that economist Gabriel Zucman detailed in <a href=\"https://archive.ph/fGe9V\">his Le Monde piece</a> I <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/01/0048137-a-soaring-us-vs-a\">posted</a> in December:\n\n<blockquote><p>More leisure time, better health outcomes, greater equality and lower carbon emissions, all with broadly comparable productivity: Europeans can be proud of their model, argues Gabriel Zucman, director of the EU Tax Observatory.</p></blockquote> \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/economics\">economics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Europe\">Europe</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Gabriel%20Zucman\">Gabriel Zucman</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Thomas%20Piketty\">Thomas Piketty</a></p>\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/02/the-triumph-of-europes-social-democracy\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>",

Not as a Valve-supported program for manufacturers to create living room PCs, but instead a home console sibling to the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-lcd-review-2023-still-one-of-the-best-handheld-pcs-140044516.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Deck</a>. Valve introduced its second attempt at ruling the living room in a surprise hardware announcement in November 2025, and paired the new <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Machine</a> with a new Steam Controller and a wireless VR headset it calls the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Frame</a>. Since the announcement, as is often the case with Valve, some details remain elusive, however.</p><p>While we wait for the release of the company's new hardware lineup in 2026, and more information straight from the horse's mouth, here's everything we know about the hardware, software and price of the Steam Machine.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-steam-machines-hardware-like\">What's the Steam Machine's hardware like?</h2><figure><img alt=\"A line-drawing diagram of the Steam Machine and its various ports.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Steam-Machine-diagram.jpg\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Valve</div></figure><p>Like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine is utilitarian and bespoke. The PC is a black, 5.98 x 6.39 x 6.14 inch (152 x 162.4 x 156mm) box, with ports and a grille for a fan in the back and a removable faceplate and customizable LED light strip in the front. Inside, Valve says the Steam Machine features a &quot;semi-custom&quot; AMD Zen 4 CPU with six cores and up to 4.8GHz clock speeds, and a &quot;semi-custom&quot; RDNA3 AMD GPU, along with 16GB DDR RAM, 8GB GDDR6 VRAM and either 512GB or 2TB of storage.</p><p>While these specs make the Steam Machine more powerful than the aging Steam Deck (which shipped in 2022 with its own custom AMD chip) Valve has been careful not to oversell the capabilities of the box. In <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post</a>, the company said that &quot;the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K 60FPS&quot; using AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) frame generation and upscaling technology, but some titles require more upscaling than others, and it &quot;may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with [variable refresh rate] to maintain a 1080p internal resolution.&quot;</p><p>In a hands-on preview of the Steam Machine, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/hands-on-with-steam-machine-valves-new-pcconsole-hybrid\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a> expressed concern with what Valve's claims and the device's stated specs could mean for future performance. &quot;The decision to opt for 8GB of GDDR6 memory has been proven to be a limiting factor on many modern mainstream triple-A games and falls short of the maximum VRAM pools and memory bandwidth available on both Xbox Series X and base PS5,&quot; <em>Digital Foundry </em>writes.</p><p>The Steam Machine supports Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6E and includes an integrated 2.4GHz adapter for the new Steam Controller. In terms of port selection, there's DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 inputs for connecting the box to external monitors and TVs, four USB-A ports (divided between two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports) and one USB-C port on the back.</p><p>Engadget will have to try out&nbsp;the Steam Machine to really know what it's capable of, but there's nothing to suggest it couldn't be as flexible as the Steam Deck, especially with more power to play with.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-games-will-be-able-to-run-on-the-steam-machine\">What games will be able to run on the Steam Machine?</h2><figure><img alt=\"A Steam Machine connected to a TV playing the game Cuphead.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Steam-Machine-over-the-shoulder.jpg\" style=\"height: 4320px; width: 7680px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Valve</div></figure><p>Any game that runs on SteamOS, Valve's Linux-based operating system, will run on the Steam Machine, provided the device's technical specs will support it. For games running natively on Linux, the Steam Machine will download the Linux version. For Windows games and everything else, it'll be able to use Steam's built-in Proton compatibility layer to translate games to Linux, just like the Steam Deck does.</p><p>Proton is developed by both Valve and CodeWeavers, the team behind the macOS compatibility app <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover\" target=\"_blank\">CrossOver</a>. Valve's compatibility layer translates a game's API calls and other software features into something Linux understands, essentially tricking the game into thinking it's running on Windows when it isn't. Proton has worked remarkably well so far, in some cases helping some PC games run more efficiently on Linux than they do on Windows, but it does have some limitations. Because some anti-cheat software <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/for-the-steam-machine-to-change-pc-gaming-valve-must-solve-linuxs-anti-cheat-problem-130000088.html\" target=\"_blank\">doesn't support Linux</a>, many competitive multiplayer games aren't playable on SteamOS. Valve hopes the Steam Machine will help change that.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;While [the] Steam Machine also requires dev participation to enable anti-cheat, we think the incentives for enabling anti-cheat on Machine to be higher than on Deck as we expect more people to play multiplayer games on it,&quot; Valve <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/will-battlefield-6-work-on-steam-machine-valve-hopes-its-new-hardware-will-prompt-a-fresh-discussion-with-developers-over-kernel-level-anti-cheat\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. &quot;Ultimately we hope that the launch of Machine will change the equation around anti-cheat support and increase its support.&quot;</p><p>To help users find what games work well on the Steam Machine, Valve plans to expand its program for verifying games on the Steam Deck to include the Steam Machine and Steam Frame. Valve looks at things like controller support, the default resolution of the game, whether or not it requires a separate launcher and whether the game and its middleware work with Proton to determine a game's rating. Then the company sorts games into four categories: Verified (where the game works with Steam hardware at launch), Playable (where a user might have to make modifications to run smoothly), Unplayable (where some or all of the game doesn't function) and Unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/563639634283728255\" target=\"_blank\">an announcement</a> Valve sent to developers, games that were Verified for the Steam Deck will automatically be verified for the Steam Machine. The system is helpful, but far from definitive — some Unplayable games are in fact playable — which is why online, community-run databases like <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.protondb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ProtonDB</a> fill in the gaps with more granular information.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-steam-machine-cost-and-when-will-it-launch\">How much will the Steam Machine cost and when will it launch?</h2><figure><img alt=\"A Steam Machine with an LED strip displaying the current download progress of a game.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Steam-Machine-led-strip.jpg\" style=\"height: 4320px; width: 7680px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Valve</div></figure><p>Valve hasn't announced a price or a release date for the Steam Machine or any of its new hardware. In terms of price, however, the company has suggested it might not be a deal in quite the same way the $399 Steam Deck LCD was. Valve designer Pierre-Loup Griffais told <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Verge</em></a> that the &quot;Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs&quot; and that its price would be &quot;positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space&quot; but be &quot;very competitive with what you a PC you could build yourself from parts.&quot;</p><p>That means the Steam Machine will likely cost more than the $499 PS5, and that the rising costs of memory could make it even more expensive. Valve has already publicly admitted that memory and storage shortages are affecting its plans. In February, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-pushes-back-steam-machine-launch-due-to-storage-and-memory-shortage-133000103.html\" target=\"_blank\">the company said</a> that it was delaying the launch of its hardware (though it still hopes to ship in the first half of 2026) and rethinking pricing, particularly around the Steam Machine and Steam Frame, because of the &quot;limited availability and growing prices&quot; of critical components like RAM.</p><p>The changes Framework had to make to the pricing of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/framework-builds-its-own-modular-desktop-191211936.html\" target=\"_blank\">Framework Desktop</a> are an illustrative example of the position Valve is in. Framework pitched its compact desktop PC as being great for gaming, with an AMD Ryzen AI Max chip (originally meant for gaming laptops) and a minimum of 32GB of RAM that lets it run games at 1440p. The company originally sold the base configuration of the Framework Desktop for $1,099, but <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/framework-increases-desktop-prices-by-up-to-460-due-to-ram-crisis-234827145.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced in January 2026</a> that it would now cost $1,139 due to the rising cost of RAM. The price situation got even worse for configurations with more RAM. A Framework Desktop with 128GB of RAM now costs $2,459.</p><p>The blame for rising costs lies squarely with the AI industry, whose demand for RAM has led to the collapse of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/crucial-is-a-casualty-of-ais-hunger-for-ram-185910113.html\" target=\"_blank\">consumer RAM brands</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/there-arent-any-black-friday-deals-on-ram-this-year-and-you-can-thank-ai-for-that-130000335.html\" target=\"_blank\">a dearth of true deals</a> on the in-demand component. At this point, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html\" target=\"_blank\">PC makers have no solution to the problem</a> other than riding the shortage out and raising prices. Valve clearly isn't immune to those same issues.</p><p>That doesn't rule out the company offering its Linux PC at multiple different price points, or in some kind of bundle deal with multiple pieces of new Steam hardware. But it does mean that the Steam Machine will likely be priced like a premium device. Same for the Steam Controller and Steam Frame. In the case of the Frame, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.uploadvr.com/valve-steam-frame-hands-on-impressions/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>UploadVR</em></a> reports that Valve wants to sell the headset for less than the $1,000 Valve Index, but that doesn't mean it won't be significantly more expensive than the $300 <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-accessories-will-work-with-the-steam-machine\">What accessories will work with the Steam Machine?</h2><figure><img alt=\"Someone holding a Steam Controller in a pile of plushies.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Steam-Controller.jpg\" style=\"height: 4320px; width: 7680px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Valve</div></figure><p>The Steam Machine is designed to work with a variety of different Bluetooth controllers and other wireless accessories, and also whatever you can plug into its multiple USB-A ports and single USB-C port. With a built-in 2.4GHz Steam Controller dongle inside the Steam Machine, Valve's controller should be an ideal option for controlling games, particularly because of its multiple control options, like touchpads and gyroscopes. Support for Steam Link, Valve's tech for streaming PC games over local wireless, means you can also send games from a Steam Machine to the Steam Deck, Steam Frame or the Steam Link app and play them there.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/everything-we-know-about-valves-new-steam-machine-200458817.html?src=rss",

Gameplay-wise, <em>Orbitals </em>looks like it’s at least partly inspired by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ea-originals-hazelight-it-takes-two-hands-on-160009642.html\"><em>It Takes Two</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Split Fiction</em>, but really what really stands out here is the  90s anime-inspired visuals.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The game is absolutely dripping in style, and somehow<em>&nbsp;</em>looks just as good in motion as it does in cutscenes. Describing it as a playable Saturday morning cartoon is getting into cliche territory, but <em>Orbitals</em> <em>really </em>nails its aesthetic.</p>\n<p>It will be a tall order for any game like this to clear the impossibly high bar for creative co-op gameplay that Josef Fares’ Hazelight Studios has set in recent years, but <em>Orbitals</em> looks like it could be worth experiencing for its visuals alone.</p>\n<p>Nintendo has managed to nab this one as a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2s-virtual-boy-is-a-tribute-to-nintendos-wackiest-console-140000003.html\">Switch 2</a> exclusive, which you can either play locally or online, and thanks to the console's GameShare feature, only one person needs to own the game for the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Orbitals </em>arrives at some point during summer 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2-exclusive-co-op-adventure-orbitals-launches-this-summer-180657892.html?src=rss",

This would be the first time in three decades that the company hasn't launched new gaming chips. The culprit? Why, AI, of course.</p><p>AI demand has driven the current memory chip shortage, throwing the consumer electronics industry out of kilter. Many product prices are <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/samsung-says-ram-costs-will-likely-lead-to-price-hikes-soon-170653524.html\" target=\"_blank\">expected to rise</a> (as if tariffs hadn't already <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html\" target=\"_blank\">done enough damage</a> there). And the scarcity of memory chips has made components that rely on them, including GPUs, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/how-to-buy-a-nvidia-rtx-50-series-gpu-160902797.html\" target=\"_blank\">nearly impossible</a> to find. Even the auto industry <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/auto-chip-shortage-honda-will-pause-production-in-japan-and-china-200857591.html\" target=\"_blank\">isn't spared</a>.</p><p>Facing those constraints, NVIDIA, which made its bones on graphics chips for PCs and gaming consoles, is essentially brushing off that demographic. <em>The Information </em>notes that in the first nine months of 2022, NVIDIA's gaming GPUs made up 35 percent of its total revenue. During that same period in 2025, only around 8 percent came from gaming components. In addition, NVIDIA's AI chips have much higher profit margins: 65 percent vs. 40 percent for graphics cards.</p><p>That means gamers, already hard-pressed to find last year's RTX 50 series, likely won't get the expected &quot;Super&quot; version in 2026. On top of that, <em>The Information</em> says the delay will also push back NVIDIA's next-gen graphics card (likely &quot;RTX 60&quot;). That component was initially expected to begin mass production at the end of 2027.</p><p>But hey, at least <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/chatgpt-now-offers-a-dedicated-shopping-assistant-180000034.html\" target=\"_blank\">you can shop</a> (and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-is-bringing-ads-to-chatgpt-192831449.html\" target=\"_blank\">view ads!</a>) in ChatGPT, have a talk <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/gmail-is-getting-a-gemini-ai-overhaul-130000422.html\" target=\"_blank\">with your Gmail inbox</a> and record <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/plauds-latest-ai-wearable-has-a-button-for-flagging-key-moments-170000172.html\" target=\"_blank\">everything the people around you say</a>.

The letters are identical to Times New Roman (and it even appears as such in font menus, except there&#8217;s &#8220;an extra space between the words Times and New&#8221;) but when you type with it, it autocorrects a list of words: &#8220;For example, the word ICE autocorrects to the Goon Squad and the word Trump autocorrects to Donald Trump is a felon.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a partial list:\n\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://kottke.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none//images/posts/01/img-48328-01.jpg\" width=\"1402\" />\n\nThe idea is that you install it on your MAGA relative&#8217;s computer and then sit back and watch the fun.

      "content_html": "<img src=\"https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.engadget.com&sz=128\" style=\"width:100%;max-height:300px;object-fit:cover;\" />\n<p>Our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\" target=\"_blank\">review of the new AirTag</a> went up yesterday, and that involved testing the new Precision Finding feature on Apple Watches. In the process, I found the setup to be confusing and counterintuitive, and was relieved to discover it wasn’t just me. If, like me, you’ve been trying to set up Precision Finding on your Apple Watch for the AirTag you’ve just unboxed and attached to a precious belonging, here are the exact steps to take.&nbsp;</p><p>First, make sure your Apple Watch is compatible with the feature. That means verifying you’re using the Series 9 or later (you would have bought it in or after 2023) or the Ultra 2 and newer. Then, go to the Watch app on your phone and do the following to make sure you’ve received the latest software update that adds the functionality.</p><ol><li><p>Tap <strong>General</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Press <strong>Software update</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Make sure the page says you are running watchOS 26.2.1. If not, tap <strong>Install Now</strong>.&nbsp;</p></li></ol><p>If you need to download the software, make sure your watch is on its charging cradle. Even though my Apple Watch Series 11 was fully charged, I was still told to make sure it’s connected to power and had at least 50 percent of juice left for the software to install. After a few minutes, my watch restarted and the app said it was updated to the newest version of watchOS.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you have the right hardware and software, you can set up Precision Finding. I assume you’ve already connected the new AirTag to the iPhone that’s linked to your watch (and if you haven’t, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-set-up-an-airtag-120000789.html\" target=\"_blank\">make sure to do that</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>This was the part of the process that confused me. Instead of opening the Find Items app on the watch, Precision Finding for the new AirTag actually exists as a shortcut in the Control Center. Here are the steps to add it there:</p><ol><li><p>Open the Control Center by pushing the button below the dial on the side of the watch.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Scroll all the way to the bottom and press “<strong>Edit</strong>.”</p></li><li><p>Push the <strong>+</strong> button at the top left of the screen.</p></li><li><p>Scroll down and tap <strong>Find Items</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Press <strong>Find AirTag</strong>, then tap <strong>Choose</strong>. You should see the new AirTag you’ve linked to your account here.</p></li><li><p>Select the AirTag you want to precisely find.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Drag the icon to whichever position you prefer within the Control Center.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Hit <strong>Done</strong>.</p></li></ol><p>Now, whenever you want to locate your item, you can pull up the Control Center, press this button and the Precision Finding interface will appear, showing how far away it is. You can also push the button on the bottom right of this screen to get the AirTag to ring, guiding you to where your item is.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-use-your-apple-watch-to-precisely-find-your-new-airtag-164922731.html?src=rss",

The sale applies to all three colorways.</p> \n<p>These easily topped our list of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">best wireless headphones</a>. They are, in a word, fantastic. The headphones are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html\">packed with premium features</a>, like advanced ANC. There are a whopping 12 ANC microphones throughout and a brand-new chip to power the feature. The end result? It successfully blocks background noise at medium and high frequencies, including the human voice.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction.</p> \n<p>The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The only real major nitpick here is the original asking price. It's tough to recommend any pair of headphones for $460, but a bit easier at under $400.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-sony-wh-1000xm6-headphones-drop-to-a-record-low-price-175038542.html?src=rss",

Valve had intended to release the console-style <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html\" target=\"_blank\">SteamOS-powered device</a> in early 2026, and AMD CEO Lisa Su just <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/amd-suggests-the-next-gen-xbox-will-arrive-in-2027-052707822.html\" target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> that the company was on track to start shipping it soon.

The release of Valve’s upcoming <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Frame VR headset</a> and controller will be delayed, as well.</p><p>Valve was hoping to be able to announce pricing and launch dates by now. The company cited industry-wide memory and storage shortages, which have grown since the Steam devices’ announcement, as the culprit for the delay. It explained that it has to rethink their exact shipping schedules and pricing due to the limited availability and the rising prices of those components. “We will keep you updated as much as we can as we finalize those plans as soon as possible,” Valve wrote.

That has led to shortages for other industries, like PCs and phones. </p><p>The Steam Machine is a compact cube-like PC for gaming powered by a semi-custom AMD CPU and GPU. Valve said during its announcement that it has “roughly six times the horsepower” of the Steam Deck and can support 4K gaming at 60 FPS with FSR. In the new post, Valve said that majority of Steam titles played great at those settings during testing, though some required more upscaling than others and may fare better when played at a lower framerate to maintain a 1080p resolution. It also revealed that you will have easy access to the Machine’s SSD and memory if you want to upgrade them. Meanwhile, the Steam Frame is a wireless, standalone VR headset that can play both PC and Android games. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-pushes-back-steam-machine-launch-due-to-storage-and-memory-shortage-133000103.html?src=rss",

The gaming division still made more profit, though, thanks to a boost in software sales and a low yen.</p><p>Sony’s first two quarters this fiscal year saw an increase in PS5s sold, so the holiday decline is a bit surprising. That said, sales during the same period the previous year were an outlier at 9.5 million units sold, far and away its best period since the console went on sale in November 2020.</p><p>Software sales, however, were exceptional in Q3 this year. Sony sold 97.2 million games compared to 95.9 million the year before, and boosted digital sales to 76 percent, up 2 percent year-over-year.

Much of the art that filters down to us from ancient civilizations was used for official purposes (state, religion, commerce); it&#8217;s nice to see something simpler like this drawing. <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/alisonfisk.bsky.social/post/3mdx7dugqzs2u\">Archaeologist Alison Fisk</a>:\n\n<blockquote><p>This may have been a practice drawing of the sparrow hieroglyph which was used for words meaning &#8216;small&#8217;, &#8216;poor&#8217;, or &#8216;bad&#8217;</p>\n\n<p>The Egyptian artisans who decorated tombs and temples, drew sketches and jotted down notes on the plentiful limestone flakes which were by-products of temple and rock-cut tomb construction. Egyptologists refer to them as &#8216;ostraca&#8217; (singular: ostracon). More info: <a href=\"https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/ostracon/\">ancientegyptonline.co.uk/ostracon/</a></p></blockquote>\n\nFrom <a href=\"https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/ostracon/\">that link</a> about ostracon:\n\n<blockquote><p>The word &#8220;ostracon&#8221; is derived from the Greek &#8220;ostrakon&#8221; (meaning a piece of pottery used as a voting ballot). When a vote was held on whether to banish a person from society these shards were used to cast votes. This is the origin of the word &#8220;ostracism&#8221; (literally meaning &#8220;to be voted out&#8221;).</p></blockquote> \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Alison%20Fisk\">Alison Fisk</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/archaeology\">archaeology</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/art\">art</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Egypt\">Egypt</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/language\">language</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Met%20Museum\">Met Museum</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/museums\">museums</a></p>\n         <p>💬 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/02/a-lovely-3500-year-old-drawing-of-a-sparrow\">Join the discussion on kottke.org</a> →</p>",

Multiple sources claim that Apple could be targeting a late-2026 launch for its first foldable phone, and new rumors suggest the company is even already thinking about its second model, which could be a clamshell-style foldable iPhone.</p><p>But of course, nothing is official yet. Plans can change, features can be dropped and timelines can slip. Still, recent reports paint the clearest picture yet of how Apple might approach a foldable iPhone and how it plans to differentiate itself from rivals like Samsung and Google.</p><p>Here, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering its possible release timing, design, display technology, cameras and price. We’ll continue to update this post as more rumors and details become available.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-could-the-iphone-fold-launch\">When could the iPhone Fold launch?</h2><p>Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://theorg.com/org/bloomberg/org-chart/mark-gurman\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Gurman</a> has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-11/apple-2027-plans-tabletop-robot-20th-anniversary-iphone-ios-19-wi-fi-feature\" target=\"_blank\">ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027</a>. Analyst <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\" target=\"_blank\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.</p><p>Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-iphone-fold-look-like\">What will the iPhone Fold look like?</h2><p>Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.</p><p>When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3030017/a-case-maker-might-have-leaked-the-iphone-fold-design.html\" target=\"_blank\">CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds</a> suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-hands-on-the-super-sleek-precursor-to-apples-upcoming-foldable-185851102.html\" target=\"_blank\"> iPhone Air as a potential preview</a> of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.</p><p>If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.</p><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a476c2e0-9780-11f0-bd4b-d87caa240702\" style=\"height: 1263px; width: 2400px;\" /><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><h2 id=\"jump-link-display-and-the-crease-question\">Display and the crease question</h2><p>The display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.</p><p>Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-crease-less-foldable-oled-panel-showcased-z-fold-8/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel</a>, which several sources — including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a> — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.</p><p>According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.</p><p>If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-cameras-and-biometrics\">Cameras and biometrics</h2><p>Camera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:</p><ul><li><p>Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)</p></li><li><p>One punch-hole camera on the outer display</p></li><li><p>One under-display camera on the inner screen</p></li></ul><p>Several sources claim <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple will avoid Face ID</a> entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-will-reportedly-bring-back-touch-id-on-a-foldable-iphone-135831748.html\" target=\"_blank\">rely on Touch ID</a> built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.</p><p>Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://wccftech.com/apples-first-foldable-iphone-to-have-a-24-megapixel-under-display-selfie-camera-no-faceid/\" target=\"_blank\">rumored 24MP sensor</a> would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-iphone-folds-hinge-and-materials\">iPhone Fold’s hinge and materials</h2><p>The hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/14/iphone-folds-titanium-liquid-metal-rumors-just-wont-go-away\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple reports claim Apple will use </a>Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.</p><p>Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/youtuber-jon-prosser-posts-foldable-iphone-renders\" target=\"_blank\">Leaks from Jon Prosser</a> also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-battery-and-other-components\">Battery and other components&nbsp;</h2><p>Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=224077504572&amp;navType=by\" target=\"_blank\">multiple Asian supply-chain reports</a>, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.</p><p>That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-price\">Price</h2><p>None of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone</a> ever.</p><p>Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,”</a> while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.</p><p>Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-foldable-design-130000349.html?src=rss",

We gave it an 83 in our review thanks to the power of its <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-unveils-a17-pro-a-3nm-chip-powering-iphone-15-pro-182113747.html\">A17 Pro chip</a> and that it comes with a minimum of 128GB of storage. The model currently on sale comes with 128GB, Wi-Fi and all four color options: Blue, Purple, Space Gray and Starlight.&nbsp;</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>We named the Apple iPad mini <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-ipads-how-to-pick-the-best-apple-tablet-for-you-150054066.html\">our favorite compact iPad</a> — though, to be fair, its only competitor is itself. Still, it's a good iPad with an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, Apple Intelligence and 12MP Wide back and 12MP Ultra Wide cameras. For 20 percent off, it's a great option for a light, useful way to entertain yourself through the rest of winter and beyond.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/ipad-deal-get-100-off-the-latest-ipad-mini-right-now-140900989.html?src=rss",

But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day.

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an \"essential accessory\" for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

The next Nintendo Direct is taking place on February 5 at 9AM ET, the company has <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2019048301518115090\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a>. It will run for around 30 minutes.</p><p>As <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-coming-next-week/\" target=\"_blank\">previous reports</a> suggested, it will focus on third-party titles from partners instead of first-party games from Nintendo itself. So if you were hoping for new Mario or Zelda announcements, that may not happen during this event. Still, you can expect to hear about new games that are coming to Switch and Switch 2. You can tune into the Direct via the YouTube video embedded above. </p><p>FromSoftware’s <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-switch-2-2026-release-142025792.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, is slated to arrive this year, so we may get another look at that (or the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-switch-2-version-of-elden-ring-is-delayed-until-2026-154500911.html\" target=\"_blank\">Switch 2 version of <em>Elden Ring</em></a>, for that matter).
