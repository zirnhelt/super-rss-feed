      "title": "NASA used Claude to plot a route for its Perseverance rover on Mars",
      "content_html": "<p>Since 2021, NASA's Perseverance rover has achieved a number of historic milestones, including sending back the first <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/perseverance-driving-on-mars-sounds-063118359.html\" target=\"_blank\">audio recordings from Mars</a>. Now, nearly five years after <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/perseverance-lands-on-mars-205800998.html\" target=\"_blank\">landing on the Red Planet</a>, it just achieved another feat. This past December, Perseverance successfully completed a route through a section of  the Jezero crater <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/mars-2020-perseverance/perseverance-rover/nasas-perseverance-rover-completes-first-ai-planned-drive-on-mars/\" target=\"_blank\">plotted by Anthropic's Claude chatbot</a>, marking the first time NASA has used a large language model to pilot the car-sized robot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Between December 8 and 10, Perseverance drove approximately 400 meters (about 437 yards) through a field of rocks on the Martian surface mapped out by Claude. As you might imagine, using an AI model to plot a course for Perseverance wasn't as simple as inputting a single prompt.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>As NASA explains, routing Perseverance is no easy task, even for a human. &quot;Every rover drive needs to be carefully planned, lest the machine slide, tip, spin its wheels, or get beached,&quot; NASA said. &quot;So ever since the rover landed, its human operators have painstakingly laid out waypoints — they call it a 'breadcrumb trail' — for it to follow, using a combination of images taken from space and the rover’s onboard cameras.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>To get Claude to complete the task, NASA had to first provide <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropic-launches-claude-cowork-a-version-of-its-coding-ai-for-regular-people-193000849.html\" target=\"_blank\">Claude Code</a>, Anthropic's programming agent, with the &quot;years&quot; of contextual data from the rover before the model could begin writing a route for Perseverance. Claude then went about the mapping process methodically, stringing together waypoints from ten-meter segments it would later critique and iterate on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This being NASA we're talking about, engineers from the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made sure to double check the model's work before sending it to Perseverance. The JPL team ran Claude's waypoints through a simulation they use every day to confirm the accuracy of commands sent to the rover. In the end, NASA says it only had to make &quot;minor changes&quot; to Claude's route, with one tweak coming as a result of the fact the team had access to ground-level images Claude hadn't seen in its planning process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>&quot;The engineers estimate that using Claude in this way will cut the route-planning time in half, and make the journeys more consistent,&quot; NASA said. &quot;Less time spent doing tedious manual planning — and less time spent training — allows the rover’s operators to fit in even more drives, collect even more scientific data, and do even more analysis. It means, in short, that we’ll learn much more about Mars.&quot;</p><p>While the productivity gains offered by AI are <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity\" target=\"_blank\">often overstated</a>, in the case of NASA, any tool that could allow its scientists to be more efficient is sure to be welcome. Over the summer, the agency <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-may-lose-close-to-4000-employees-after-latest-deferred-resignation-round-204452249.html\" target=\"_blank\">lost about 4,000 employees</a> – accounting for about 20 percent of its workforce – due to Trump administration cuts. Going into 2026, the president had proposed gutting the agency's science budget by <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/trumps-defunding-of-nasa-would-be-catastrophic-153053020.html\" target=\"_blank\">nearly half</a> before Congress ultimately <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/senate-passes-minibus-bill-funding-nasa-rejecting-trumps-proposed-cuts-231605536.html\" target=\"_blank\">rejected that plan in early January</a>. Still, even with its funding preserved just below 2025 levels, the agency has a tough road ahead. It's being asked to return to the Moon with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.planetary.org/charts/nasa-workforce-chart\" target=\"_blank\">less than half the workforce</a> it had during the height of the Apollo program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For Anthropic, meanwhile, this is a major feat. You may recall last spring Claude <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/claude-isnt-a-great-pokemon-player-and-thats-okay-151522448.html\" target=\"_blank\">couldn't even beat <em>Pokémon Red</em></a>. In less than a year, the company's models have gone from struggling to navigate a simple 8-bit Game Boy game to successfully plotting a course for a rover on a distant planet. NASA is excited about the possibility of future collaborations, saying &quot;autonomous AI systems could help probes explore ever more distant parts of the solar system.&quot;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/nasa-used-claude-to-plot-a-route-for-its-perseverance-rover-on-mars-203150701.html?src=rss",

The custom “vanbulance” serves a dual purpose: preventing on-set exhaust fumes (which could harm the cast and crew) and integrating a green storyline. “As an added benefit, the elimination of engine noise brought a welcome quiet while cameras were rolling,” Rivan wrote in a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://stories.rivian.com/greys-anatomy-vanbulance-rivian-commercial-van\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a>.</p><figure><img alt=\"View of an ambulance interior for a Hollywood set\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/rivian_2.jpg\" style=\"height: 2044px; width: 3408px;\" /><figcaption>Among other modifications, it has rear double doors instead of a roll-up one.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Rivian</div></figure><p>The vehicle includes some production-specific touches. Its walls and roof panels are removable, allowing cameras to reach angles required for interior shots. In addition, Rivian replaced the standard van’s rear roll-up door with double doors while adding a side entry to the cargo area. The company also added custom lighting and an exterior wrap reading “Seattle Emergency Response Services.”</p><p>The team consulted with the Huntington Beach Fire Department and the Los Angeles Fire Department to inform the interior layout. “Their feedback was invaluable to understand how first responders actually use their vehicles,” Rivian wrote.</p><figure><img alt=\"An electric ambulance used on a Hollywood set\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/imgi_16_cover-1769725585.jpg\" style=\"height: 2200px; width: 3300px;\" /><figcaption>At least Hollywood's fictional worlds are transitioning to electric.</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Rivian</div></figure><p><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/greys-anatomy-electric-ambulance-season-22-1236488768/\" target=\"_blank\">notes</a> that the electric ambulance debuted in the November 13, 2025, episode of <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>.

It’s what’s known as a world world, an AI system capable of generating images and reacting as the user moves through the environment the software is simulating. At the time, DeepMind positioned Genie 3 as a tool for training AI agents. Now, it’s making the model available to people outside of Google to try with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-deepmind/project-genie/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Genie</a>. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>To start, you’ll need Google’s $250 per month AI Ultra plan to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html\" target=\"_blank\">check out Project Genie</a>. You’ll also need to live in the US and be 18 years or older. At launch, Project Genie offers three different modes of interaction: World Sketching, exploration and remixing. The first sees Google’s <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Banana Pro</a> model generating the source image Genie 3 will use to create the world you will later explore. At this stage, you can describe your character, define the camera perspective — be it first-person, third-person or isometric — and how you want to explore the world Genie 3 is about to generate. Before you can jump into the model’s creation, Nano Banana Pro will “sketch” what you’re about to see so you can make tweaks. It’s also possible to write your own prompts for worlds others have used Genie to generate. </p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that Genie 3 is not a game engine. While its outputs can look game-like, and it can simulate physical interactions, there aren’t traditional game mechanics here. Generations are also limited to 60 seconds, as is the presentation, which is capped at 24 frames per second and 720p. Still, if you’re an AI Ultra subscriber, this is a cool opportunity to see the bleeding edge of what DeepMind has been working over the past couple of years.         </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-project-genie-lets-you-create-your-own-3d-interactive-worlds-183646428.html?src=rss",

Its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $88 for two years, plus four additional free months. The Basic plan is where you'll see the biggest discount: it's $68 for two years, plus the same four additional free months.</p> \n<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html\">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> \n<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/save-up-to-81-percent-on-expressvpn-two-year-plans-right-now-180602273.html?src=rss",

      "title": "The best cheap VPN in 2026",
      "content_html": "<p>When talking about the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs</a>, I frequently warn about the dangers of trusting free VPNs without verifying them. Although there are a few free VPNs worth recommending, many other free providers are ineffective, malicious or looking to profit off their users (or sometimes all three). Even the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-free-vpn-120032818.html\" target=\"_blank\">best free VPNs</a> work a lot better once you subscribe and access their full service.<br /><br />This can be frustrating if you want to enjoy the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/what-is-a-vpn-and-what-can-you-do-with-one-161549146.html\" target=\"_blank\">benefits of a VPN</a> but don't have the budget for yet another subscription. To help you out, I put together a list of the best paid VPN services you can get cheaply. Every name on the list comes with my full recommendation — I'll never recommend a VPN that doesn't protect you, no matter how affordable.<br /><br />Before I get started, I want to define &quot;cheap,&quot; since VPNs often bamboozle the customer with muddled pricing schemes. Most providers have long-term subscription plans with big discounts, and many of them compensate by making their monthly plans more expensive. On this list, I'll recommend services with cheap subscriptions for both the short and long term, plus one favorite that balances both.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-cheap-vpns-for-2026\">Best cheap VPNs for 2026</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-vpns-we-tested-with-good-deals\"><strong>Other VPNs we tested with good deals</strong></h2>\n<p>A couple of VPNs have decent pricing options attached to worthy services but weren't quite strong enough to make the list. Both these services get my hearty recommendation; they're just hard to justify as &quot;cheap.&quot;</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-expressvpn\"><strong>ExpressVPN</strong></h3>\n<p>ExpressVPN recently switched to a multi-tier pricing model. The Basic pricing tier gets you complete VPN service but doesn't include the full set of features. The best price on that is $78.18 for 28 months, which works out to $2.79 per month. Although that sounds great, it's more expensive than both Surfshark and CyberGhost at the same duration and renews at the even higher price of $99.95 per year ($8.33 per month).</p>\n<p>Still, as I wrote in my full <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/vpn-review-expressvpn-2023-gaming-streaming-160052492.html\" target=\"_blank\">ExpressVPN review</a>, it's an outstanding service overall. Thanks to its sensible app layouts and focus on doing simple tasks well, I find it especially good for introducing beginners to what a VPN can do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-nordvpn\"><strong>NordVPN</strong></h3>\n<p>NordVPN is another provider that I gave a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/nordvpn-review-2025-innovative-features-a-few-missteps-163000578.html\" target=\"_blank\">relatively positive review</a>. I really like its boundary-pushing features, especially the various types of highly specialized servers. Its pricing isn't bad, exactly, but even the Basic level is more expensive than just about everyone else at every duration. NordVPN's fast download speeds and wide server network make it worthwhile for lots of users, but it's hard to recommend to people on a budget.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-good-cheap-vpn\"><strong>What to look for in a good cheap VPN</strong></h2>\n<p>Looking for an affordable VPN is the same as looking for any kind of VPN; it just requires more care. The worst VPNs usually present themselves as free, but there's also a fair number of mediocre options that think low prices have to mean a mediocre service. If you want to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-use-a-vpn-140000564.html\" target=\"_blank\">use a VPN</a> but don't have much extra cash, take some additional care in a few areas of your search.</p>\n<p>First, don't subscribe to a VPN — or even download any of its apps — if you haven't verified its security. To do that, start by checking what experts have to say about it. If a VPN is truly unsafe, chances are high that somebody has already sounded the alarm. You can also check the list of protocols the VPN offers. If it's anything other than OpenVPN, WireGuard or IKEv2, do a deep dive to make sure it's using worthwhile encryption.</p>\n<p>If you've verified that the VPN isn't a virus, check to see if it has a free trial or a guaranteed money-back period. This will give you some risk-free time to do hands-on tests. Our article on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-we-test-vpns-175845189.html\" target=\"_blank\">how we test VPNs</a> includes several tests you can run on your own computer, phone or tablet. Check the VPN's speed, make sure it has the server locations you need and look for anything that might be leaking your real IP address.</p>\n<p>Read the VPN's privacy policy and make sure you're comfortable with how much information it saves. Some VPNs emphasize privacy more than others. Finally, before your free trial or refund period expires, make sure to double-check on the pricing structure of the VPN you're choosing — it's possible that it will only be cheap for the first subscription period.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-cheap-vpn-170000957.html?src=rss",

But if a reluctance to add yet another subscription to your <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/best-streaming-services-154527042.html\">streaming</a> rotation means you haven’t watched Amazon’s surprisingly excellent adaptation yet, you might be interested to know that the company is currently releasing season one for free on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@PrimeVideo\"><ins>Prime Video</ins></a> YouTube channel.</p>\n<p>Whether driven by Amazon wanting even more people to watch what has become one of its biggest TV <a href=\"https://movieweb.com/fallout-season-2-streaming-viewership-update-prime-video/\"><ins>success</ins></a> stories, or a move that speaks to how few people are actually signed up for Prime Video, it’s good news for anyone who hasn’t seen the show yet. <em>Fallout</em>’s first season did a great job of taking everything that’s great about the long-running post-apocalyptic RPG series and weaving it into a wildly entertaining live-action show, elevated by excellent performances from Ella Purnell as a hopelessly naive but endearingly optimistic vault-dweller, and Walton Goggins as the Ghoul.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Amazon is currently adding a new episode each day ahead of next week’s season two finale, presumably hoping a whole new set of fans hop straight into that once they’re done. But here’s the catch: you only have until February 11 to watch the whole lot. After that, the show will be for Prime Video subscribers only once again.</p>\n<p>And that isn't the the only Fallout freebie up for grabs right now. Between now and February 5, Bethesda’s MMORPG, <a href=\"https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/freeplay\"><em><ins>Fallout 76</ins></em></a>, is free-to-play on Xbox and PC, while PlayStation players have until February 4. <em>Fallout 76 </em>first launched in 2018, and as a fully multiplayer-focused game it represented a new direction for the series. It was, to put it bluntly, a bit of a mess for quite a while, but Bethesda has never abandoned the title or its player-base, and if you have Fallout on the brain, this is the perfect opportunity to see how it’s looking in 2026.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/the-first-season-of-amazons-fallout-show-is-now-free-on-youtube-162920615.html?src=rss",

Instead of laboring over a spreadsheet, you can try one of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html\">our favorite budgeting apps</a> for less than usual. <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=1764214b-3509-4628-8631-8692fa12e904&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjE3NjQyMTRiLTM1MDktNDYyOC04NjMxLTg2OTJmYTEyZTkwNCIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAf9OYtqtov5bl24yd1K5MnBqj85n36sOszbLnLpvqV4W&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F\">Monarch Money</a> is running a sale that gives new users 50 percent off one year of the service, bringing the final cost down to just $50. Just use the code <strong>NEWYEAR2026</strong> at checkout to get the discount.</p> \n<p>Monarch Money makes for a capable and detailed budgeting companion. You can use the service via apps for iOS, Android, iPadOS or the web, and Monarch also offers a Chrome extension that can sync your Amazon and Target transactions and automatically categorize them. Like other budgeting apps, Monarch Money lets you connect multiple financial accounts and track your money based on where you spend it over time. Monarch offers two different approaches to tracking budgeting (flexible and category budgeting) depending on what fits your life best, and the ability to add a budget widget on your phone so you can know how you're tracking that month.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>How budgeting apps turn your raw transactions into visuals you can understand at a glance is one of the big things that differentiates one app from another, and Monarch Money offers multiple graphs and charts to look at for things like spending, investments or categories of your choice based on how you've labelled your expenses. The app can also monitor the spending of you and your partner all in one place, to make it easier to plan together.</p> \n<p>The main drawbacks Engadget found in testing Monarch Money were the app's learning curve, and the differences in features (and bugginess) between Monarch's web and mobile versions. Still, for 50 percent off, the Monarch Money is well worth experimenting with if you're trying to save money in 2026, especially if you want to do it collaboratively with a partner.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/monarch-money-deal-new-users-get-one-year-of-access-for-only-50-204507285.html?src=rss",
