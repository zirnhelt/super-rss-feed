Thomas also revealed that the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/the-golden-trump-phone-is-almost-certainly-not-made-in-the-us-174536590.html\">T1 smartphone</a> will go through &quot;final assembly&quot; in Miami and no longer be &quot;proudly designed and built in the United States,&quot; as seen in the introductory <a href=\"https://www.trump.com/media/trump-mobile-launches-a-bold-new-wireless-service\">press release</a>. Instead, the website now shows a description that says, &quot;with American hands behind every device.&quot; We still don't have a release date — and now we don't even have a final price — but the website still claims the T1 smartphone will be released &quot;later this year.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/trump-mobiles-t1-phone-is-apparently-still-coming-but-itll-be-uglier-and-more-expensive-190626835.html?src=rss",

Now that February is here, our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/reviews/\" target=\"_blank\">reviews</a> team is flush with new devices to test, which means you’ve got a lot to catch up on if you haven’t been following along. Read on for a roundup of the most compelling new gear we’ve tested recently from gaming, PCs, cameras and more. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-nex-playground\">Nex Playground</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>If you still have a fondness for the Xbox Kinect, the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/the-nex-playground-is-everything-xbox-kinect-wanted-to-be-133000397.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nex Playground</a> might be right up your alley. Senior reporter Devindra Hardawar recently put the tiny box through its paces and found an active gaming experience that’s fun for the whole family. “While I have some concerns about the company’s subscription model, Nex has accomplished a rare feat: It developed a simple box that makes it easy for your entire family to jump into genuinely innovative games and experiences,” he wrote.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-msis-prestige-14-flip-ai\">MSI's Prestige 14 Flip AI+</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Devindra also tested MSI’s latest laptop, the powerful <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-prestige-14-flip-ai-review-an-ultraportable-for-arc-raiders-thanks-to-intels-panther-lake-160000606.html\" target=\"_blank\">Prestige 14 Flip AI+</a>. While the machine got high marks for its performance, display and connectivity, he noted that the overall experience is hindered by subpar keyboard and truly awful trackpad. “As one of the earliest Panther Lake laptops on the market, the $1,299 Prestige 14 Flip AI+ is a solid machine, if you're willing to overlook its touchpad flaws,” he explained. “More than anything though, the Prestige 14 makes me excited to see what other PC makers offer with Intel's new chips.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-shokz-openfit-pro\">Shokz OpenFit Pro</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Fresh off of its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html\" target=\"_blank\">Best of CES</a> selection, I conducted a full review of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/shokz-openfit-pro-review-reducing-distractions-while-keeping-your-ears-open-130000443.html\" target=\"_blank\">OpenFit Pro</a> earbuds from Shokz.

The issue was first spotted by <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1pt5fqa/removing_dolby_vision_without_even_an/\" target=\"_blank\">German Disney+ subscribers on Reddit</a>, but currently also impacts subscribers in Portugal, Poland, France and the Netherlands, according to <em>FlatpanelsHD</em>.</p><p>&quot;Dolby Vision support for content on Disney+ is currently unavailable in several European countries due to technical challenges,&quot; Disney said in a statement. &quot;We are actively working to restore access to Dolby Vision and will provide an update as soon as possible. 4K UHD and HDR support remain available on supported devices.&quot;</p><p>If the issue is in fact a technical one, it seems like it could be around for the long-term. Disney has removed any reference to Dolby Vision from its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://help.disneyplus.com/en-GB/article/disneyplus-video-quality\" target=\"_blank\">Disney+ video quality support page in Germany</a>. As of now, the company lists HDR10 as its default HDR format, despite <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.dolby.com/experience/home-entertainment/articles/disney-in-dolby-vision/\" target=\"_blank\">Dolby Vision support</a> being a feature of Disney+ for several years now.&nbsp;</p><p><em>FlatpanelsHD</em> writes that the real issue might be legal, rather than technological. A company called InterDigital <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ir.interdigital.com/news-events/press-releases/news-details/2025/InterDigital-awarded-injunction-against-Disney-by-German-court/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">won an injunction in a German court</a> against Disney in November 2025 because it violated at least one of the company's patents on streaming video technology. The injunction specifically requires Disney to stop violating InterDigital's patent on &quot;a method for dynamically overlaying a first video stream with a second video stream comprising, for example, subtitles.&quot; It's not entirely clear how that plays into the company offering Dolby Vision in Europe, but it would explain why subscribers in Germany were some of the first people to notice Dolby Vision's absence.</p><p>Engadget has contacted Disney for more information about Disney+'s missing HDR support and whether InterDigital's injunction played a role. We'll update this article if we hear back.</p><p>Mentions of Dolby Vision were also stripped out of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-video-quality\" target=\"_blank\">the US version</a> of Disney+'s video quality support page. InterDigital hasn't won an injunction in the US, but the company is <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69604250/1/interdigital-inc-v-the-walt-disney-company/\" target=\"_blank\">pursuing a patent case</a> against Disney in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. That doesn't necessarily mean Dolby Vision support will be taken from US subscribers next, but it does suggest there's more happening here than just technical challenges.</p><p><strong>Update, February 6, 3:44PM ET:</strong> The original version of this article included mention of Disney+ losing HDR10+ support in Europe, but Disney says it never offered HDR10+ in that region. The article has been updated accordingly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-loses-access-to-dolby-vision-in-some-european-countries-193930702.html?src=rss",

The device is intended to exceed the quality offered by a device's existing hardware.</p> \n<p>Sceptre is powered by Qualcomm's QCC5181 Bluetooth chipset and supports LDAC, aptX Adaptive, AAC and SBC codecs. Of course, to take advantage of the high quality codecs you'll need a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\"><ins>pair of headphones</ins></a> that support them. The dongle has a reported wireless range of roughly 66 feet.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Listeners use the Noble app for initial pairing and can then move the dongle between compatible USB-C devices. It also supports pass-through charging with USB-C so users can charge their devices while listening. The company says Sceptre is compatible with iOS, Android and Windows, and the company confirmed with Engadget that iPhones 15 and newer are supported.</p> \n<p>We've been pleased in the past with Noble Audio products, like the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html\"><ins>FoKus Apollo headphones</ins></a>, or the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html\"><ins>FoKus Rex5 earbuds</ins></a>.

Apple, Samsung, Sony and other big tech companies all have affordable gear that comes in at $100 or less, you just have to know where to look.

But it's still a phone, arguably your most used device on a daily basis, so you may need to top it up during the day if you're using it constantly.

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.
