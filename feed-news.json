      "content_html": "<img src=\"https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fd29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net%2Fimages%2Fuser-uploaded%2Fc200.jpg&resize=1400%2C840&client=19f2b5e49a271b2bde77&signature=07c412e3df032c2d3687635e77db6eb2e0a754fc\" style=\"width:100%;max-height:300px;object-fit:cover;\" />\n<p>There’s a type of knife tech often seen in science fiction that revolves around vibrating a blade to increase its sharpness. We’ve seen examples of this in franchises like Star Wars (vibroblades), Evangelion (the prog knife), Dune (pulse-swords) and the Marvel universe (vibranium), but what might surprise you is that the underlying science is sound. By vibrating a cutting tool at high frequencies, not only do you reduce friction, you essentially turn the blade into a saw, as tiny oscillations enhance the inherent sharpness of a blade.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, up until recently, this tech largely only existed in fiction or for large companies that have the money to utilize the tech on an industrial scale. But that's changing in a big way for home cooks this year thanks to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://seattleultrasonics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seattle Ultrasonics</a>, which is releasing the world's first ultrasonic chef's knife: the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://seattleultrasonics.com/products/c-200-ultrasonic-8-chefs-knife?variant=41673675636832\" target=\"_blank\">C-200</a>. After chopping, smashing and cooking with it for about a month, I'm convinced that this is the future of kitchen knives.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h2>\n<p>From afar, the C-200 looks a lot like a regular 8-inch chef's knife, but with a slightly more contemporary design. It features a three-layer san mai blade made from Japanese AUS-10 steel with a 13-degree edge angle per side (26 degrees total). However, upon closer inspection, you'll notice there are some features that seem a bit out of place on a premium knife.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first is that the C-200 doesn't have a full tang, which is the back end of a blade that ideally extends into the handle to provide added strength and durability. This is usually a major no-no, particularly on a $400 knife. However, when you consider that Seattle Ultrasonics needed somewhere to put its vibration tech, there really isn't any room for it other than inside the knife's grip.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"You won't be able to feel, but pressing this button allows the C-200's blade to vibrate 30,000 times per second. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/c200-button.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  You won't be able to feel it, but pressing this button allows the C-200's blade to vibrate 30,000 times per second. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>The knife's second quirk is that the back of the plastic handle features small indicator lights on either side, which is obviously a bit weird. Furthermore, the entire gray section can be removed to reveal a small 1,100mAh battery with an onboard USB-C port. Frankly, the presence of a battery in a knife is just kind of funky. But hey, the power to vibrate the knife has to come from somewhere because it definitely isn't being generated by your hands. And while Seattle Ultrasonics doesn't include a charging adapter or cable in the box, I don't mind because the company wisely took cues from the larger gadget industry and went with a power spec that's already widely in use. Honestly, I wish more kitchen tech makers would do the same.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, the knife's biggest oddity is the big orange button on the bottom of its handle. This is what you use to make the blade vibrate, which it does at 33kHz. It's positioned well so that it's easy to press regardless of whether you do a traditional <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8KlpqZ3A5gs\" target=\"_blank\">pinch grip</a> or if you're a bit more casual and prefer to hold the knife only using its handle. In the future, I can see this button becoming a touch-sensitive sensor, but for now, it's simple and effective.</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Here's a small selection of knives I own sorted by weight (from top to bottom) compared to the C200: 6-inch Kyocera ceramic knife (97 grams), MAC molybdenum steel chef's knife (110g), Furtif Evercut titanium carbide chef's knife (190g), Seattle Ultrasonics C-200 (328g), Korin carbon steel cleaver (396g).\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/c200-size-and-weight-comp.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Here's a small selection of knives I own sorted by weight (from top to bottom) compared to the C200: 6-inch Kyocera ceramic knife (97 grams), MAC molybdenum steel chef's knife (110g), Furtif Evercut titanium carbide chef's knife (190g), Seattle Ultrasonics C-200 (328g), Korin carbon steel cleaver (396g).\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>The main downside to the C-200's design is that at 328 grams (around 0.75 pounds) it's heavier and bulkier than a typical knife. When compared to other knives I own, which are made from a wide variety of materials including, ceramic, molybdenum steel, carbon steel and even titanium carbide, it weighs more than everything else aside from my big Chinese cleaver (396 grams). And while it fits nicely in my hand, my wife said it takes a bit more effort for her to wield. It's not too much to the point where you don't want to use it. But for quick tasks, sometimes I found myself subconsciously reaching for lighter options like my 6-inch ceramic knife, which weighs just 97 grams.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-it-works\">How it works</h2>\n<p>From a user standpoint, putting the C-200 to work couldn't be simpler. Just press the button and let the knife do its thing. The big difference from how knives like this work in sci-fi is that there's no audible hum or detectable vibration when it's on. It's practically silent (well, most of the time, but more on that later), so you have to trust that it's on or check the indicator light on the handle. That said, if you still don't believe anything is happening, you can run the edge of the blade under water or scrape it over some cut citrus, at which point the blade's vibration will atomize nearby liquid into a fine mist. It's a cool party trick that also doubles as a way to amp up a cocktail by adding a faint essence of lemon, lime or anything else you can think of.</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Pushing the C-200's button is super easy, regardless of what kind of knife grip you prefer. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/c200-grip.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Pushing the C-200's button is super easy, regardless of what kind of knife grip you prefer. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>Inside, the knife relies on PZT-8 piezoelectric ceramic crystals to generate up to 30,000 vibrations per second, which propagate down the blade and make the knife function as if it's sharper than it actually is. This all sounds rather fantastic, so how does it function in the real world?</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-in-use\">In-use</h2>\n<p>To really put the C-200 through its paces, I cooked over a dozen meals that involved neatly slicing or preparing a wide variety of foods — including Hasselback potatoes, flank steak, pork belly, chives, sushi-grade tuna and all sorts of fruit.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"After prepping four pounds of pork belly with various knives, the C-200 really showed off how much of a difference its vibration tech makes. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cutting-pork-belly.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  After prepping four pounds of pork belly with various knives, the C-200 really showed off how much of a difference its vibration tech makes. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>In short, the C-200's effectiveness depends a lot on what you're chopping. For soft things like strawberries or a piece of cake, I didn't notice much of a difference. To make things even more difficult, the knife arrived out of the box with an incredibly fine edge — the kind that makes shearing through a sheet of paper child's play. So even though Seattle Ultrasonics says its knife can reduce cutting effort by up to 50 percent, there's not much gain to be had when slicing foods that could just as easily be cut by a butter knife.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, as I used it more, I found that the C-200 excels at cutting through delicate items like tomatoes, scallions and fish, where using a dull knife often results in bruising the food as you chop. This was most evident when I made poke at home, where Seattle Ultrasonic's knife delivered cleaner, more precise cuts than anything else I own.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"For me, the C-200's $399 price tag is almost worth it just so I have an an easier time making my one of my all-time favorite dishes (lu rou fan).\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/lu-rou.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  For me, the C-200's $399 price tag is almost worth it just so I have an an easier time making my one of my all-time favorite dishes (lu rou fan).\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>When I whipped up some pico de gallo, I distinctly noticed how neatly the C-200 sliced through the skin of a tomato, instead of initially putting a crease in it before cleanly passing through its interior — which often happens when using dull knives. An additional benefit is that because of the vibrations, I found some foods like garlic didn't stick to the side of the blade as much. This made it easier to keep track of how much I chopped while simultaneously reducing the mess from things falling willy-nilly during prep. But perhaps the most obvious demonstration of the knife's prowess was when I diced an onion. When using my other knives or the C-200 without powering it on, I could feel when I tried to cut through thicker, more sturdy layers. But then, at the touch of a button, I was able to slice down with practically no resistance. It's almost shocking because it feels like magic.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"The C-200 truly excels at cutting denser foods like flank steak. Sadly mine ended up closer to medium than medium rare, but that's not the knife's fault. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/flank-steak.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  The C-200 truly excels at cutting denser foods like flank steak.

Anyone who's seen all the posts on r/kitchenconfidential about <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://dailydot.com/reddit-chive-chopping-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">cutting chives</a> will already know what I'm talking about. As J Kenji Lopez-Alt <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Sja-bbEYxwM\" target=\"_blank\">neatly demonstrated</a>, the ideal way to get crisp, clean slices is to do a subtle forward or back cut instead of simply chopping straight down. But with Seattle Ultrasonics' knife, I've found that it's so sharp you can get away with almost any motion and still get good results. And if you do it the right way, things are even better.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other types of food that makes the C-200 really shine are denser ingredients like meat and potatoes, where you can really feel the added cutting power. Previously, when I had to break down thick cuts of protein, I sometimes wished I owned a <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cf388304-7638-4f1e-91cc-18cafe85ccd2&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=serrated+electric+knife&amp;custData=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&amp;signature=AQAAATU9lFZ429hD8iW1YNqUlqTdVS_YKGy56mGNOMD94bvx&amp;gcReferrer=http%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FHamilton-Beach-Reciprocating-Stainless-Ergonomic%2Fdp%2FB0BNQXXT2F%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3\" target=\"_blank\">serrated electric knife</a>. You know, the kind you break out once a year on Thanksgiving and then it sits and gathers dust for the other 364 days. But the C-200 made that desire a thing of that past, as it quickly and easily worked through flank steak while once again producing neat, uniform slices.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Sushi-grade tuna is another food that really shows off how the C-200's increased sharpness is better at preserving the delicate texture of the fish. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/poke.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Sushi-grade tuna is another food that really shows off how the C-200's increased sharpness is better at preserving the delicate texture of the fish. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>My favorite application of the C-200 was when I was doing prep for <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/taiwanese-minced-pork-sauce?srsltid=AfmBOoqiUChuRpRjoY6JVbXgwhqF7wva-WGxJ7uKPtPehcrVUiV9Q5Ys\" target=\"_blank\">Taiwanese braised pork</a> (aka 滷肉飯). Despite this being one of my most beloved dishes that I taught myself how to cook because I couldn't easily find it from local restaurants, I don't make it very often because it's a lot of work to cut multiple pounds of pork belly into small lardon-shaped pieces. Here, the knife's vibrations made it so much easier to cut through all those layers of meat, fat and skin. If there's any situation where the C-200 makes it 50 percent easier to slice through something, it's this.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"It might be hard to tell, but I was able to cut chives a little finer and more neatly with the C-200 (left) than with my other knives. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/chives.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  It might be hard to tell, but I was able to cut chives a little finer and more neatly with the C-200 (left) than with my other knives. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>During my testing, two small issues cropped up. While it was quite rare, the knife would sometimes emit a faint high-pitched whine. When I asked Seattle Ultrasonic's founder Scott Heimendinger about this behavior, he was rather frank, saying that this can occur when water or moisture accumulates in just the right spots on the blade. Furthermore, he said this only happens on a small number of V1 models, which the company is working to fix in the future. Thankfully, I don't mind, but if it bothers you, making the noise go away is as easy as wiping down the knife down with a cloth or paper towel.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"The C-200s battery can be easily removed for cleaning and charging.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/c200-battery.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  The C-200s battery can be easily removed for cleaning and charging.\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>The other complication came while I was working through the multiple pounds of pork belly I mentioned earlier. After 10 to 15 minutes of continuous use, the knife beeped and its indicator light turned red. Turns out the knife had overheated, which was something I had not even considered. This led to higher-than-normal temperatures inside the knife's sealed electronics causing it to shut off. But after just 30 seconds, it returned to form. During later uses, I learned that simply taking my finger off the button between tasks, which happens naturally as you prep anyway, was more than enough to stop that situation from happening ever again.</p>\n<p>On the flipside, I was happy to discover that despite lacking a full tang, the C-200 can handle fairly rough tasks, including laying the knife on its side to smash garlic or jamming it into an avocado to remove its pit. That said, I would really recommend against doing the latter, because between its inherent sharpness and its vibration tech, this is the first knife I've used that can slice cleanly through an entire avocado with almost no extra effort.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-cleaning-and-care\">Cleaning and care</h2>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"The Seattle Ultrasonics C-200 8-inch chef's knife features an IP65 rating for the whole device, though the front half is actually a bit more resistant thanks to an IP67 rating for its button and bolster. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/c200-washing.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  The Seattle Ultrasonics C-200 8-inch chef's knife features an IP65 rating for the whole device, though the front half is actually a bit more resistant thanks to an IP67 rating for its button and bolster. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>The last big concern about a knife with built-in electronics is how it handles clean-up. Thankfully, the C-200 features an IP65 rating for dust and water resistance. That means it can withstand rinsing and splashes without issue. And it's actually even tougher than that, because the front of the knife, including its bolster and button, are rated IP67. This means it can take full submersions in water if need be. However, just because you can, doesn't mean you should. Good kitchen protocol says you don't throw knives you care about in the sink and forget them, just like how you wouldn't put one in the dishwasher either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But perhaps the greatest advantage of this tech is that it allows you to go longer between needing to get your knives sharpened, which if you're like most home cooks, is probably never. To be clear, I haven't tested this and in some respects I wish I had been able to test out a dull version of the C-200. That said, science dictates that slice for slice, an ultrasonic knife will simply cut better than an equivalent blade without the extra tech. So if you believe in the adage that a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one because you need to apply more force to get the same results, this is another bonus for both safety and convenience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-not-so-optional-accessory\">The not-so-optional accessory</h2>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"Seattle Ultrasonics' wireless charging tile makes it incredibly easy to forget that the C-200 needs to be topped up between uses. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/c200-charging-tile.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  Seattle Ultrasonics' wireless charging tile makes it incredibly easy to forget that the C-200 needs to be topped up between uses. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>I fully admit the need to keep a knife charged up is a major annoyance and something I or anyone else probably doesn't want to do. Thankfully, Seattle Ultrasonics thought of that by including support for wireless charging via the C-200's magnetic tile and it's dead simple to use. Just toss it on the charger when you're not using and it will take care of itself, so you never have to worry about how much of its normal 20-minute runtime it may or may not have left. There are also holes around back so you can easily mount the charger on a wall or shelf. In short, the added convenience the charging tile brings is so valuable that I don't really consider it an optional accessory. If you're getting the C-200, you need to buy this too, which sadly means you're looking at an all-in price of $500 for the bundle instead of just $400 for the knife by itself.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-wrap-up\">Wrap-up</h2>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"As much as I love old-school knives, they'll simply never be as sharp an equivalent blade with this newfound tech. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/cut-tuna.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  As much as I love old-school knives, they'll simply never be as sharp an equivalent blade with this newfound tech. \n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Sam Rutherford for Engadget\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>After using the C-200, I don't think people need to rush out and throw all their old-school knives in the trash. The beauty of an ultrasonic blade like this is that it can handle everything your old cutlery is meant for, but with the touch of a button, it delivers sharpness unlike anything you've experienced before. And while it has some quirks, they're nothing like the kind you typically encounter on first-gen gadgets. Its biggest drawback is that its magnetic charging tile feels like an essential accessory, but it adds extra cost on top of a product that already has a deservedly premium price tag.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even though I'm sure knife makers will continue tweaking blade shapes and alloy mixes from now until the end of time, the addition of ultrasonic vibrations to a chef's knife unlocks a completely new tier of performance. That's because this technology is additive. All it does is enhance what a blade already does best. And when you look at related gadgets in the maker space, I don't think it's a coincidence that there's a similar revolution that resulted in Adam Savage of <em>Mythbusters</em> fame naming a sonic cutter as one of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://youtu.be/-3SgDTOg1GA?t=1088\" target=\"_blank\">his favorite things of 2025</a>.

The agreement is structured in a way that could see AMD issue Meta up to 160 million shares of its common stock provided GPU shipment milestones are achieved — meaning Meta could own up to 10 percent of AMD if the deal fully completes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meta plans to purchase six gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs based on the MI450 architecture and optimized for Meta's workloads, with the first gigawatt deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026. AMD and Meta will also expand on their EPYC CPU partnership, with Meta deploying &quot;millions&quot; of AMD EPYC CPUs and become a launch customer for its sixth-generation EPYC CPUs.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The tranche of AMD common stock will vest with the first one gigawatt of shipments, with additional tranches vesting as Meta scales to 6 gigawatts. Vesting is tied to AMD hitting certain stock price thresholds and Meta achieving certain technical and commercial milestones. The deal is very similar to one that AMD structured with OpenAI last year, with AMD <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-agrees-to-buy-tens-of-billions-worth-of-amd-chips-134816630.html\">obtaining</a> up to a 10 percent stake in AMD in exchange for six gigawatts of Instinct GPUs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Such deals are being likened to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/microsoft-and-nvidia-will-invest-up-to-15-billion-in-anthropic-173432863.html\">circular transactions</a> that have created a tangle of interconnected dependencies between AI companies and chip manufacturers. Analysts have observed that such deals may magnify losses if demand for AI doesn't match the sky-high market expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The agreement also shows that AI companies are keen to diversify away from NVIDIA, with AMD being a key alternative. &quot;By diversifying our partnerships and technology stack, we’re building a more resilient and flexible infrastructure,&quot; Meta wrote in its news release.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/meta-may-trade-ai-chips-for-shares-in-its-latest-amd-deal-134259842.html?src=rss",

They’re powered by Intel’s new <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-intel-hopes-its-core-ultra-series-3-chips-are-the-start-of-a-comeback-000155611.html\" target=\"_blank\">Core Ultra Series 3</a> processors, which were also announced at CES and which promise great graphics and battery life. </p><p>All three models come in grey and with AI features, such as AI Select and Search that you can use to look for information using natural language. The basic Book 6 laptop will set you back at least $1,050, while the Book 6 Pro’s prices start at $1,600. The Book 6 Ultra will cost you at least $2,450. The Galaxy Book 6 Pro will be available in 14- and 16-inch versions and will come equipped with up to Core Ultra X7 processors and Intel Arc graphics. Meanwhile, you can equip the 16-inch Galaxy Book 6 Ultra with up to Core Ultra X9 processors. The most expensive Book 6 promises significant performance improvements, thanks to its new 5th-generation MPU, Intel Arc graphics and NVIDIA’s RTX 50 series GPUs. </p><p>The Book 6 Ultra and the 16-inch Pro have slimmer profiles than their predecessors, though the former has a more traditional laptop shape and the latter looks more like the MacBook Air. It’s worth noting that Samsung redesigned the Ultra’s components across a larger surface area so that it can distribute heat more evenly. Both the Book 6 Pro and Ultra can last for up to 30 hours of video playback, since they feature Samsung’s longest-lasting batteries yet. Both models also come with AMOLED 2X (2,880 x 1,800) displays with refresh rates going up to 120Hz. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/samsung-galaxy-book-6-series-will-be-available-in-the-us-starting-on-march-11-125140613.html?src=rss",

The keynote starts at 10AM PT (1PM ET) and will be livestreamed on YouTube. The announcement on February 10 also said this launch will mark “a new phase in the era of AI as intelligence becomes truly personal and adaptive.”</p>\n<p>What are we <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-the-galaxy-s26-and-other-devices-that-might-launch-on-february-25-130000063.html\">expecting</a>? Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not likely to have radically reinvented the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, sticking instead with a similar design to the Galaxy S25.</p>\n<p>We’re expecting Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site <em>Yonhap News</em> reports Samsung’s relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be in some devices, depending on the region.</p>\n<p>Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard, which added support for convenient magnetic alignment, Samsung still hasn’t brought the feature to its phones. Rumours suggest the S-series will have the spec’s higher speed wireless charging rates but will lack built-in magnets and have to depend on cases to add MagSafe-style charging and mounting.</p>\n<p>Honestly? It could be a pretty mild launch event, especially after wowing everyone with the Galaxy TriFold at the start of the year.</p>\n<p>Are you more interested in foldables than traditional candy bar devices?

Telegram was one of the apps that <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/russias-recent-blocking-of-telegram-is-reportedly-disrupting-its-military-operations-in-ukraine-135250159.html\" target=\"_blank\">Russia blocked</a> in the country just a few days ago, along with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/whatsapp-is-now-fully-blocked-in-russia-110953485.html\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp</a>, in what seemed to be an effort to push local users towards the unencrypted state-owned app, Max. </p><p>When Telegram was banned, pro-Russian voices criticized the country’s decision, because it was apparently harming frontline operations. Russia’s own soldiers are using the app to communicate and coordinate their moves. Authorities near the Ukrainian border, for instance, send out warning for incoming drone and missile attacks through the messaging app. Even Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson uses Telegram to speak to the media.</p><p>Now, the <em>Times</em> says Russia is accusing Telegram of being the main instrument for “NATO countries’ secret services and the Kyiv regime.” Rossiiskaya Gazeta, a Russian state-run publication, added that Telegram was “intercepting location data, selling secret information and intimidating soldiers and their families.” Digital platforms like Telegram, the publication said, are “becoming strategic weapons.” Rossiiskaya Gazeta said its information came from Russia’s Federal Security Service, the country’s primary domestic security agency.  </p><p>Durov has yet to issue a statement, but after Russia blocked access to Telegram, he said the country was restricting access” to the application to “force its citizens onto a state-controlled app built for surveillance and political censorship.” The Telegram founder was born in Russia and co-founded the country’s largest social network, VK. He left his country after Kremlin pressured him to sell his stake in the social network. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/telegram-founder-pavel-durov-is-reportedly-under-criminal-investigation-in-russia-121000511.html?src=rss",

The <a href=\"https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us\">game will end service</a> on April 9, less than a year after its October 2025 debut. The Amazon Games-published title will be playable until that date, but will then be taken entirely offline.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to King of Meat, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for,&quot; the announcement read.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Developer Glowmade had high hopes for King of Meat, its debut game, but it fell starkly short of expectations. The developer wanted a concurrent player count of at least 100,000, but peaked at 320, <a href=\"https://insider-gaming.com/king-of-meat-glowmade-layoffs/\">according to <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>. The game had a multi-million dollar marketing budget that included a video on MrBeast's YouTube channel and custom-wrapped London buses. The company even made a pilot for an animated TV show. Here at Engadget, we were so-so on a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/king-of-meat-preview-a-monstrous-mash-up-of-a-co-op-platformer-183015893.html\">preview version of the game</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>December brought voluntary redundancies to Glowmade after previous assurances to staff. Anyone who has purchased King of Meat will be able to get a refund through their purchase platform and, in most cases, these refunds should process automatically by April 9.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While it seems that King of Meat struggled to reach its audience, Amazon has a history of pulling games that are popular. Last fall, Amazon Games announced it would <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-winding-down-its-still-popular-new-world-mmo-amid-mass-layoffs-150500426.html\">wind down support for <em>New World: Aeternum</em></a>, which first debuted in 2021. The news came as the division faced layoffs, but just that week the game had reached almost 50,000 concurrent players on Steam.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/amazon-games-is-winding-down-king-of-meat-113049172.html?src=rss",

Up until now, though, only Anthropic's model has been allowed for the military's most sensitive tasks in intelligence, weapons development and battlefield operations. Claude was reportedly used in the Venezuelan raid in which the US military exfiltrated the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>However, the Pentagon demanded that Anthropic make Claude available for &quot;all lawful purposes&quot; including mass surveillance and the development of fully autonomous weapons. Anthropic reportedly refused to offer its tech for those things, even with a &quot;safety stack&quot; built into that model.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>xAI, by contrast, agreed to a standard that would allow the DoD to employ its AI for any purpose it deems &quot;lawful.&quot; However, the xAI model is not considered by officials to be as cutting-edge or reliable as Anthropic's Claude, and they admit that replacing Claude with Grok would be a challenge. The Pentagon is reportedly also negotiating deals with OpenAI and Gemini, both of which it considers to be on par with Anthropic.</p>\n<p>xAI had <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/xai-starts-offering-grok-to-us-government-agencies-162952893.html\">announced a version</a> of Grok for US government agencies in July 2025.

Apple says it will turn the space into a 220,000 square feet plant where it will produce the compact desktop computers. The decision to produce Mac minis for local sales within the US is part of the company’s efforts to make good on its pledge last year that it will <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-plans-to-invest-500-billion-in-the-us-over-the-next-four-years-181217017.html\" target=\"_blank\">spend $500 billion</a> in the US over the next four years. </p><p>If you’ll recall, Apple announced it was going to ramp up its investments and hiring in the US after Tim Cook met with President Trump. The president said at the the time that the company was growing its US investments because it wanted to avoid tariffs. Prior to that pledge, during the Biden administration in 2021, Apple vowed to invest $430 billion domestically over the following five years. </p><p>As the <em>Journal</em> notes, Apple previously made Mac Pros in a facility in Texas, but production in the plant has dwindled in recent years. Sabih Khan, Apple’s COO, told the <em>Journal</em> that the company feels more confident in projecting the Mac mini’s long term demand. At the same time, the model makes up a tiny portion of Apple’s sales, making it one of the company’s best options if it wants bring more production into the US. It will be incredibly difficult, after all, to move the production of a more in-demand product, say the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ig.ft.com/us-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone</a>, stateside. The companies making and assembling iPhones in China already have factories fitted for and people with skills honed for the production of Apple’s best-selling device. </p><p>Khan said the Houston facility will be able to meet local demand as production ramps up, insinuating that it might start small. Apple will also continue manufacturing Mac minis in Asia for everyone else in the world.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-will-start-making-mac-minis-in-the-us-101000341.html?src=rss",

On its website, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/detecting-and-preventing-distillation-attacks\">Anthropic</a> claimed that <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/commerce-department-divisions-reportedly-ban-deepseek-from-government-devices-140916241.html\">DeepSeek</a>, Moonshot and MiniMax have been conducting &quot;industrial-scale campaigns…to illicitly extract Claude’s capabilities to improve their own models.&quot;</p>\n<p>Distillation in the AI world refers to when less capable models lean on the responses of more powerful ones to train themselves. While distillation isn't a bad thing across the board, Anthropic said that these types of attacks can be used in a more nefarious way. According to Anthropic, these three Chinese AI firms were responsible for more than &quot;16 million exchanges with Claude through approximately 24,000 fraudulent accounts.&quot; From Anthropic's perspective, these competing companies were using Claude as a shortcut to develop more advanced AI models, which could also lead to circumventing <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/anthropics-claude-ai-now-has-the-ability-to-end-distressing-conversations-201427401.html\">certain safeguards</a>.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Anthropic said in its post that it was able to link each of these distilling attack campaigns to the specific companies with &quot;high confidence&quot; thanks to IP address correlation, metadata requests and infrastructure indicators, along with corroborating with others in the AI industry who have noticed similar behaviors.</p>\n<p>Early last year, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-suddenly-thinks-intellectual-property-theft-is-not-cool-actually-amid-deepseeks-rise-154249605.html\">OpenAI</a> made similar claims of rival firms distilling its models and banned suspected accounts in response. As for Anthropic, the company behind Claude said it would upgrade its system to make distillation attacks harder to do and easier to identify.

The Live Kickoff show will once again be hosted by Geoff Keighley and takes place on June 5 at 5PM ET. This is where we'll see all of those juicy reveals and trailers.</p>\n<p>The opening event will be streamed globally on just about every digital platform, including YouTube, Twitch, X and even Steam. Those in the Los Angeles area will be able to pick up tickets for the live show sometime in the Spring.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The kickoff event is just the beginning. There's something called Play Days, which is an expo in downtown LA produced by iam8bit. This invite-only event promises &quot;immersive exhibits and hands-on experiences from the industry's leading publishers and developers.&quot; Coverage of this will be shared across digital and social platforms.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, another <a href=\"https://www.dayofthedevs.org/\"><ins>Day of the Devs</ins></a> livestream scheduled for immediately after the kickoff. Day of the Devs: SGF Edition should provide us with even more trailers and reveals, this time for indie games.</p>\n<p>Finally, there's a &quot;thought leadership event&quot; on June 8 that's primarily for developers and publishers. Game Business Live &quot;brings together top industry voices on one stage for insightful discussions on key changes, challenges and opportunities shaping the global video game industry.&quot;</p>\n<p>We'll be covering the event live and will have all of those trailers ready to go.

In the blog post, Bungie detailed that <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungie-shares-first-looks-at-gameplay-from-its-new-shooter-marathon-alongside-a-release-date-213530509.html\">Marathon</a>'s dedicated servers have full authority on movement, shooting, actions, and inventory. Since these key actions rely on the server, it will translate to smoother gunplay for players as well as the prevention of cheats related to teleportation, unlimited ammo or damage manipulation. Bungie is also incorporating a &quot;Fog of War&quot; system that limits an individual player's client to see only certain regions of a map, which should prevent wall hacks, ESP cheats or loot revealers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On top of these robust regulations, Bungie is utilizing BattlEye, a kernel-level anticheat that's seen with other popular multiplayer shooters like <em>Fortnite</em>,<em> Rainbow Six Siege </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em><a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bungie-destiny-2-player-lawsuit-cheating-harassment-200942428.html\"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>. Bungie added that in the event of disconnecting, you'll be able to reconnect to your run without any hitches. If players can't reconnect due to an issue with the servers, Bungie said it will &quot;attempt to return the starting gear to all impacted players.&quot;</p>\n<p>Marathon isn't out until March 5, but Bungie is doing a preview weekend with the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon-server-slam\">Server Slam</a> event starting February 26. Still, it's obvious that Bungie already wants to get ahead of the competition, since Arc Raiders, another recently released extraction shooter, has been dealing with its own cheating problem. To address the rise in cheating, the game's developer, Embark Studios, implemented a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/27/arc-raiders-new-3-strike-cheater-permaban-is-annoying-players/\">three-strike system</a>, which some players have criticized as too lenient.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungie-says-no-second-chances-if-youre-caught-cheating-in-marathon-191633998.html?src=rss",

However, the company jumped the gun a bit and just posted an <a href=\"https://x.com/nothing/status/2025857432602153377\"><ins>actual photo of the hardware</ins></a>. It looks pretty nifty, even if we don't have any real-deal specs just yet.</p>\n<p>The image shows the handset from behind, displaying the company's trademark transparent design. The picture also features the redesigned Glyph Bar, <a href=\"https://x.com/nothing/status/2024853756588732689\"><ins>which was first teased last week</ins></a>. This is a light-based notification system that features individually controlled mini-LEDs that light up in various ways to notify the user of missed calls and stuff like that. You can spot it next to the camera bump.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"144145a352244f578d287ab6bec0906e\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Built different.<br />Phone (4a). 5 March, 10:30 GMT. <a href=\"https://t.co/n3ZtbTmYIv\">pic.twitter.com/n3ZtbTmYIv</a></p>— Nothing (@nothing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nothing/status/2025857432602153377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>That's about all we know right now, though there are plenty of industry rumors.

The chaotic brick-breaking action is coming to iOS and Android on March 12. There will be a free trial with no ads, and you can unlock the full game with an in-app purchase. This is <em>Ball x Pit</em> “for your pants pocket,” according to the latest trailer. </p><p>For the uninitiated, <em>Ball x Pit </em>is sort of a mix of <em>Breakout </em>and <em>Vampire Survivors </em>with some base building (and elements of many other genres) blended in. It’s all about finding powerful synergies between the character(s) you select, passive abilities and the balls you use to take out enemies before they get too close to damage you. These balls are regular ones that deal damage on impact (aka baby balls) or special balls that are infused with a range of effects and powers, such as Lightning, Ghost and Poison. These special balls can be fused to combine their effects or evolved into more powerful versions. </p><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 743px;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">BALL x PIT is going MOBILE! 📱🏐<br /><br />🗓️ Launching on iOS &amp; Android March 12<br /><br />💸 Try-before-you-buy: try it for free, no ads!

I’m still waiting for developer Kenny Sun to add cross-progression since I’ve already plowed dozens of hours into this game on PS5, PC and Xbox — it’s available on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 as well. <em>Ball x Pit </em>is also currently on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ball-x-pit-will-land-on-ios-and-android-on-march-12-175159137.html?src=rss",

According to a report from <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/business/companies-markets/article/lamborghini-scraps-electric-car-plans-in-favour-of-hybrids-lspfbp300\"><em>The Sunday Times</em></a>, Lamborghini has abandoned making a production version of the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lamborghini-teases-a-fully-electric-supercar-ahead-of-its-august-18th-reveal-201059772.html\">Lanzador</a> EV concept, which was expected to hit the market in 2029.</p>\n<p>Stephen Winkelmann, chairman and CEO of Lamborghini, told <em>The Sunday Times</em> that there was &quot;close to zero&quot; interest from its customer base for battery-powered EVs. Winkelmann also revealed that the verdict to kill off the Lanzador was made late last year, but this is the first public confirmation of the decision after Lamborghini's grand reveal of the <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.lamborghini.com/en-en/news/lamborghini-unveils-the-lanzador-future-electric-emotion\">EV concept</a> in August 2023. The automaker's CEO told <em>The Sunday Times</em> that &quot;EVs, in their current form, struggle to deliver this specific emotional connection,&quot; adding that the lack of noise could have played a part in failing to attract customers.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Instead, Lamborghini will replace the Lanzador with another plug-in <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-lamborghini-sian-hybrid-technology-interview.html\">hybrid electric vehicle</a>, like its <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/lamborghinis-plug-in-hybrid-supercar-runs-for-a-cool-six-miles-in-electric-only-mode-183728414.html\">Reveulto</a> and Urus. With this change, Lamborghini's entire lineup will be hybrid EVs by 2030, with Winkelmann confirming that the company would continue making internal combustion engines &quot;for as long as possible.&quot; Still, the CEO hinted to <em>The Sunday Times</em> that Lamborghini could pursue another all-electric car in the future, but &quot;only when the time is right.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/lamborghini-ditches-plans-for-its-all-electric-supercar-due-to-close-to-zero-buyer-interest-173441263.html?src=rss",

He also wears a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Taro#/media/File:Yoko_Taro_cropped.jpg\"><ins>giant and rather unsettling moon mask</ins></a> for some reason. The NieR franchise is known for rich and complex lore, with a story spanning thousands of years that occasionally dips into a parallel universe.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><figure><img alt=\"It's him in a moon mask.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/45209e00-10d5-11f1-93df-540dd239e30e\" style=\"height: 898px; width: 1068px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Wikimedia Commons </div></figure>\n<p><em>Evangelion</em> veteran Kazuya Tsurumaki will be on hand to direct episodes, which is nice for long-time fans.

The new series will be produced by Studio Khara and Cloverworks.</p>\n<p>While we know a fair bit about who's behind the scenes of the upcoming show, we don't know anything about the plot. We don't know if it's yet another remake of the original story, a sequel or some kind of spin-off like the chibi-inspired <em>Petit Eva: Evangelion@School</em>.

It's worth remembering, after all, that <em>NieR</em> is actually a spin-off of a PS2 game called <em>Drakengard</em>. In one of the multiple endings of that game, a final boss is transported from a fantasy realm to modern-day Tokyo. Slaying this beast releases a virus that plagues humankind, which is what eventually leads to the post-apocalyptic setting of <em>NieR</em>. This is sort of like if the events of a Dragon Quest game somehow led to the world of Resident Evil.</p>\n<div id=\"2d66a8547a474341af629aef963c1fff\"></div>\n<p>If there's anyone who can breathe fresh life into the Evangelion franchise, it's Taro.

The release comes after Apple's 2020 <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-31-apple-dark-sky-weather-app.html\"><ins>acquisition of Dark Sky</ins></a>, which it ultimately <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dark-sky-ios-shutdown-psa-203747733.html\"><ins>shut down</ins></a> in 2022 after integrating much of its tech into the native iOS Weather app.</p>\n<p>Acme Weather is primarily designed to address the uncertainty inherent in most forecasts, as different models yield disparate results and no two weather apps seem to report the same thing. Acme’s answer to this issue is “Alternate Predictions,” which shows users a range of possible outcomes alongside the app's core forecast line throughout the day. If the lines are arranged together tightly, it means the app has high confidence in the forecast at that time. When those lines start to diverge, the app is signaling lower confidence while showing users alternate predictions for that time of day.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The app also supports community reporting, seeking to do for weather what Waymo did for traffic. Users can share real-time conditions in their area using icons or emojis, helping increase accuracy when conditions are changing quickly. Like most weather apps, there is also a map component with layers for radar, lightning, rain and snow totals, wind and more.</p>\n<p>Acme leverages notifications to help make sure you don't miss important changes to the forecast or weather alerts. Grossman says they are comprehensive and should help you avoid getting caught in the rain unawares. Notifications also include community reports, government weather alerts and even experimental tools from &quot;Acme Labs&quot; like rainbow and beautiful sunset alerts.</p>\n<p>Acme offers a two-week free trial, then costs $25 a year. The iOS version is available now and an Android is forthcoming.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/the-creators-of-dark-sky-have-a-new-weather-app-155426063.html?src=rss",
