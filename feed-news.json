Senior reporter Devindra Hardawar recently put the tiny box through its paces and found an active gaming experience that’s fun for the whole family. “While I have some concerns about the company’s subscription model, Nex has accomplished a rare feat: It developed a simple box that makes it easy for your entire family to jump into genuinely innovative games and experiences,” he wrote.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-msis-prestige-14-flip-ai\">MSI's Prestige 14 Flip AI+</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Devindra also tested MSI’s latest laptop, the powerful <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/msi-prestige-14-flip-ai-review-an-ultraportable-for-arc-raiders-thanks-to-intels-panther-lake-160000606.html\" target=\"_blank\">Prestige 14 Flip AI+</a>. While the machine got high marks for its performance, display and connectivity, he noted that the overall experience is hindered by subpar keyboard and truly awful trackpad. “As one of the earliest Panther Lake laptops on the market, the $1,299 Prestige 14 Flip AI+ is a solid machine, if you're willing to overlook its touchpad flaws,” he explained. “More than anything though, the Prestige 14 makes me excited to see what other PC makers offer with Intel's new chips.”</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-shokz-openfit-pro\">Shokz OpenFit Pro</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Fresh off of its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/engadgets-best-of-ces-2026-all-the-new-tech-that-caught-our-eye-in-las-vegas-200057123.html\" target=\"_blank\">Best of CES</a> selection, I conducted a full review of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/shokz-openfit-pro-review-reducing-distractions-while-keeping-your-ears-open-130000443.html\" target=\"_blank\">OpenFit Pro</a> earbuds from Shokz. I continue to be impressed by the earbuds’ ability to reduce ambient noise while keeping your ears open. And the overall sound quality is excellent for a product that sits outside of your ears. </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-sony-a7-v\">Sony A7 V</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Contributing reporter Steve Dent has been busy testing cameras to start the year. This week he added the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cameras/sony-a7-v-review-awesome-speed-and-photo-quality-130000592.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sony A7 V</a> to the list, noting the excellent photo quality and accurate autofocus. “The A7 V is an incredible camera for photography, with speeds, autofocus accuracy and image quality ahead of rivals, including the Canon R6 III, Panasonic S1 II and Nikon Z6 III,” he said. “However, Sony isn’t keeping up with those models for video.” </p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-apple-airtag-2026\">Apple AirTag (2026)</h2>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Our first Editors’ Choice device of 2026 is Apple’s updated <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\" target=\"_blank\">AirTag</a>. All of the upgrades lead to a better overall item tracker, according to UK bureau chief Mat Smith. “There's no doubt the second-gen AirTags are improved, and thankfully, upgrading to the new capabilities doesn’t come at too steep a cost,” he concluded. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-shokz-openfit-pro-nex-playground-sony-a7-v-and-more-123400089.html?src=rss",

The issue was first spotted by <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DisneyPlus/comments/1pt5fqa/removing_dolby_vision_without_even_an/\" target=\"_blank\">German Disney+ subscribers on Reddit</a>, but currently also impacts subscribers in Portugal, Poland, France and the Netherlands, according to <em>FlatpanelsHD</em>.</p><p>&quot;Dolby Vision support for content on Disney+ is currently unavailable in several European countries due to technical challenges,&quot; Disney said in a statement. &quot;We are actively working to restore access to Dolby Vision and will provide an update as soon as possible. 4K UHD and HDR support remain available on supported devices.&quot;</p><p>If the issue is in fact a technical one, it seems like it could be around for the long-term. Disney has removed any reference to Dolby Vision from its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://help.disneyplus.com/en-GB/article/disneyplus-video-quality\" target=\"_blank\">Disney+ video quality support page in Germany</a>. As of now, the company lists HDR10 as its default HDR format, despite <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.dolby.com/experience/home-entertainment/articles/disney-in-dolby-vision/\" target=\"_blank\">Dolby Vision support</a> being a feature of Disney+ for several years now.&nbsp;</p><p><em>FlatpanelsHD</em> writes that the real issue might be legal, rather than technological. A company called InterDigital <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ir.interdigital.com/news-events/press-releases/news-details/2025/InterDigital-awarded-injunction-against-Disney-by-German-court/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">won an injunction in a German court</a> against Disney in November 2025 because it violated at least one of the company's patents on streaming video technology. The injunction specifically requires Disney to stop violating InterDigital's patent on &quot;a method for dynamically overlaying a first video stream with a second video stream comprising, for example, subtitles.&quot; It's not entirely clear how that plays into the company offering Dolby Vision in Europe, but it would explain why subscribers in Germany were some of the first people to notice Dolby Vision's absence.</p><p>Engadget has contacted Disney for more information about Disney+'s missing HDR support and whether InterDigital's injunction played a role. We'll update this article if we hear back.</p><p>Mentions of Dolby Vision were also stripped out of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-video-quality\" target=\"_blank\">the US version</a> of Disney+'s video quality support page. InterDigital hasn't won an injunction in the US, but the company is <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69604250/1/interdigital-inc-v-the-walt-disney-company/\" target=\"_blank\">pursuing a patent case</a> against Disney in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. That doesn't necessarily mean Dolby Vision support will be taken from US subscribers next, but it does suggest there's more happening here than just technical challenges.</p><p><strong>Update, February 6, 3:44PM ET:</strong> The original version of this article included mention of Disney+ losing HDR10+ support in Europe, but Disney says it never offered HDR10+ in that region. The article has been updated accordingly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/disney-loses-access-to-dolby-vision-in-some-european-countries-193930702.html?src=rss",

But it's still a phone, arguably your most used device on a daily basis, so you may need to top it up during the day if you're using it constantly. That’s where Apple’s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFH9BST&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b81fb587-99ff-4a0a-8491-b9b9460d3e9a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=iPhone+Air+MagSafe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjgxZmI1ODctOTlmZi00YTBhLTg0OTEtYjliOTQ2MGQzZTlhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1QiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR9o3Bk1eGEoY_MpvpdVaX8WwrXHv-kJY6NrXwaRfhTy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFH9BST\">iPhone Air MagSafe</a> battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

The jury found Uber liable for its driver’s misconduct, determining that the driver was an agent of the company. Part of Uber’s defense was that it’s not responsible for what its drivers do, as they are independent contractors. This decision is for but one of the 3,000 similar cases against Uber that have been consolidated in federal court. It was a bellwether trial meant to determine the possible outcomes of the other cases, as well as the possible settlements. As <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/05/uber-liable-sexual-assault\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Guardian</em></a> explains, the results for this case could be used as a precedent for all the other pending lawsuits if the verdict is upheld by the appeals court. </p><p>The case chosen for the bellwether trial was filed by Jaylynn Dean, who said she was raped by her Uber driver in 2023. Dean said she was intoxicated when she ordered an Uber to take her back home from her boyfriend’s apartment after celebrating passing a test for her flight attendant training. The driver allegedly stopped at a dark parking lot and raped her in the backseat. </p><p>Uber argued that the driver had no criminal history, had completed training and had excellent passenger feedback. The company’s camp also presented its safety measures, including the development of a machine-learning tool that can assess the risk of potential rides. But Dean’s lawyers showed evidence during the trial that she was tagged as high risk for a serious safety incident just before her ride arrived and that she wasn’t notified about it. They also presented documents suggesting that Uber resisted introducing in-car cameras, because it would slow down growth. “Women know it’s a dangerous world. We know about the risk of sexual assault,” Dean’s layer said in her closing arguments. “They made us believe that this was a place that was safe from that.“</p><p>Despite the jury holding Uber liable for the incident, it determined that the company wasn’t negligent when it comes to safety practices and its app’s safety systems were not faulty. “This verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety,” an Uber spokesperson told <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=ef631ab7-7c73-42e0-97a9-1c697e2fae00&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAyLzA1L2J1c2luZXNzL3ViZXItc2FmZXR5LXJhcGUtdmVyZGljdC5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJlZjYzMWFiNy03YzczLTQyZTAtOTdhOS0xYzY5N2UyZmFlMDAiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjYvMDIvMDUvYnVzaW5lc3MvdWJlci1zYWZldHktcmFwZS12ZXJkaWN0Lmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAATPTswD6nYamDOi7LRrHP8rF5fzTOZHDETs7IupDj_eG&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2026%2F02%2F05%2Fbusiness%2Fuber-safety-rape-verdict.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.

At the time, Google said it intended to expand the feature to other devices at a later date, and that date could be just around the corner.</p>\n<p>At a press briefing attended by <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-airdrop-expansion-3638222/\"><em><ins>Android Authority</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>at Google’s Taipei office, Eric Kay, Android’s Vice President of Engineering, confirmed that AirDrop interoperability will expand in 2026. &quot;We spent a lot of time and energy to make sure that we could build something that was compatible not only with iPhone but iPads and MacBooks,&quot; he said. &quot;Now that we’ve proven it out, we’re working with our partners to expand it into the rest of the ecosystem, and you should see some exciting announcements coming very soon.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Right now, Pixel 10 users can send and receive files and photos between Apple devices and Android using Quick Share. For an Android device to receive from an iPhone, they have to set their Quick Share visibility settings to &quot;everyone for 10 minutes&quot; and make sure they’re in &quot;receive&quot; mode on the Quick Share page.</p>\n<p>It’s a similar story for an Android-to-Apple file share. You have to set your iPhone, iPad or Mac’s Airdrop visibility to &quot;anyone for 10 minutes,&quot; which enables someone from outside your contacts to use Quick Share on their Pixel 10.</p>\n<p>When this feature launched, it wasn’t clear how much involvement, if any, Apple had had, or if the infamous walled garden would once again banish Android-minded intruders in a subsequent software update. But that hasn’t happened, and back in November, Qualcomm <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/snapdragon-devices-will-soon-be-able-to-transfer-files-to-iphones-via-quick-share-164835065.html\"><ins>confirmed</ins></a> that devices powered by its Snapdragon chips would also soon be able to transfer files to iPhones using Quick Share, suggesting that Pixel exclusivity wouldn’t last for much longer.</p>\n<p>Google’s own willingness to play nice with Apple gear is seemingly a move designed to make the lives easier of anyone thinking about making the jump from an iPhone to an Android device. As reported by <em>Android Authority</em>, Kay also said his company was committed to making it as simple as possible to transfer data when switching.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t that long ago that the idea of Apple and Google teaming up to make device-hopping more consumer-friendly was the stuff of fantasy, but in December it <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-and-apple-partner-on-better-android-iphone-switching-204738960.html\"><ins>emerged</ins></a> that the longstanding rivals were working on a new simplified data transfer system. Each company already offers a method for swapping ecosystems, but a new build of Android Canary hinted at something that would work at the operating system level.</p>\n<p>Last month, Apple and Google also released a joint statement <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apples-siri-ai-will-be-powered-by-gemini-153636649.html\"><ins>confirming</ins></a> previous <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/apple-will-reportedly-use-a-custom-version-of-gemini-to-power-the-new-siri-203046995.html\">reports</a> that the new version of Siri will utilise Google Gemini’s models, effectively resulting in a Google-powered voice assistant on your iPhone.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/google-will-soon-offer-airdrop-support-on-more-android-devices-141523521.html?src=rss",

Now, though, the European Union has <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_312\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> those aspects of the app illegal and may order the company to alter them. </p><p>“Today, the European Commission preliminarily found TikTok in breach of the Digital Services Act for its addictive design,” the EU’s regulator said in a press release. “This includes features such as infinite scroll, autoplay, push notifications, and its highly personalized recommender system.” It said that TikTok failed to put up safeguards to ensure that those “addictive” features don’t “harm the physical and mental wellbeing of users,” including minors. </p><p>“For example, by constantly ‘rewarding' users with new content, certain design features of TikTok fuel the urge to keep scrolling and shift the brain of users into ‘autopilot mode'. Scientific research shows that this may lead to compulsive behaviour and reduce users' self-control,” the regulators stated.</p><p>TikTok’s current parental controls and features to limit screen time are insufficient, the Commission added, and TikTok may need to modify them. The platform may also be required to limit its infinite scroll and adjust its recommendation algorithms. </p><p>The EU Commission will give TikTok an opportunity to rebut the findings and the company said would use “any means available” to challenge them.  “The commission’s preliminary findings present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform,” the company told <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=c813ae39-7d58-41cb-ac66-ad830606ceef&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=d7cc7b7f-e565-4335-84fe-946b235ebd80&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=The+New+York+Times&amp;linkText=The+New+York+Times&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ueXRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDI2LzAyLzA2L2J1c2luZXNzL3Rpa3Rvay1hZGRpY3RpdmUtZGVzaWduLWV1cm9wZS5odG1sIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkN2NjN2I3Zi1lNTY1LTQzMzUtODRmZS05NDZiMjM1ZWJkODAiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjYvMDIvMDYvYnVzaW5lc3MvdGlrdG9rLWFkZGljdGl2ZS1kZXNpZ24tZXVyb3BlLmh0bWwifQ&amp;signature=AQAAARkwvFdKzF5p-gCf2iJog8iuE8Zqd1LeGrji5EGIZeeR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2026%2F02%2F06%2Fbusiness%2Ftiktok-addictive-design-europe.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The New York Times</em></a> in a statement.</p><p>Europe opened its wide-ranging investigation against TikTok in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-eu-opens-a-wide-ranging-probe-into-tiktok-132036506.html\" target=\"_blank\">February 2024</a> and has already found the company at fault for its data sharing practices and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-tech-chiefs-believe-tiktok-is-breaking-ad-transparency-rules-181706441.html\" target=\"_blank\">advertising transparency</a>.

It sold less than 800,000 units, with only 22 games in Japan and 14 in North America. And it didn’t even have the guts to launch in Europe or Australia.</p><p>But Nintendo doesn’t care. It’s brought the Virtual Boy back, baby, as an add-on for the Switch 2, in all its red monochrome ’90s-tech glory. And we finally got to test it.&nbsp;</p><p>It even includes the original bipod, which you use to prop it up and lean into it. Yes, you still can’t just <em>wear</em> the thing like modern VR headsets. The Switch 2 console, <em>sans</em> Joy-Cons, then slides in, acting as display, battery and processor.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems more of a historical nod than anything else. This is pretty much 30-year-old VR tech, as-is. But… I still want one as a gaming objet d’art. A hundred bucks is a fair chunk of change for that, though.

Colophon: All the rest. Luxury Kafka (permalink) Having been through the US immigration process (I got my first work visa more than 25 years ago and became a citizen in 2022), it's obvious to me that Americans have no idea how weird and tortuous their immigration system is: https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/52177745821/ As of a couple years ago, Americans' ignorance of their own immigration system was merely frustrating, as I encountered both squishy liberals and xenophobic conservatives talking about undocumented immigrants and insisting that they should \"just follow the rules.\" But today, as murderous ICE squads patrol our streets kidnapping people and sending them to concentration camps where they are beaten to death or deported to offshore slave labor prisons, the issue has gone from frustrating to terrifying and enraging. Let's be clear: I played the US immigration game on the easiest level. I am relatively affluent &#8211; rich enough to afford fancy immigration lawyers with offices on four continents &#8211; and I am a native English speaker. This made the immigration system ten thousand times (at a minimum) easier for me than it is for most US immigrants. There are lots of Americans (who don't know anything about their own immigration system) who advocate for a \"points-based\" system that favors rich people and professionals, but America already has this system, because dealing with the immigration process costs tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, and without a lawyer, it is essentially unnavigable. Same goes for Trump's \"Golden Visa\" for rich people &#8211; anyone who can afford to pay for one of these is already spending five- or six-figure sums with a white shoe immigration firm. I'm not quite like those people, though. The typical path to US work visas and eventual immigration is through a corporate employer, who pays the law firm on your behalf (and also ties your residency to your employment, making it risky and expensive to quit your job). I found my own immigration lawyers through a friend's husband who worked in a fancy investment bank, and it quickly became apparent that immigration firms assume that their clients have extensive administrative support who can drop everything to produce mountains of obscure documents on demand. There were lots of times over the years when I had to remind my lawyers that I was paying them, not my employer, and that I didn't have an administrative assistant, so when they gave me 48 hours' notice to assemble 300 pages of documentation (this happened several times!), it meant that I had to drop everything (that is, the activities that let me pay their gigantic invoices) to fulfill their requests. When you deal with US immigration authorities, everything is elevated to the highest possible stakes. Every step of every process &#8211; work visa, green card, citizenship &#8211; comes with forms that you sign, on penalty of perjury, attesting that you have made no mistakes or omissions. A single error constitutes a potential falsification of your paperwork, and can result in deportation &#8211; losing your job, your house, your kid's schooling, everything. This means that, at every stage, you have to be as comprehensive as possible. This is a photo of my second O-1 (\"Alien of Extraordinary Ability\") visa application. It's 800 pages long: https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/2242342898/ The next one was 1200 pages long. Like I say, I became a citizen in 2022 (for some reason, my wife got her citizenship in 2021, even though we applied jointly). At that point, I thought I was done with the process. But then my kid applied to university and was told that she should sign up for FERPA, which is the federal student loan and grant process; she got pretty good grades and there was a chance she could get a couple grand knocked off her tuition. Seemed like a good idea to me. So we filled in the FERPA paperwork, and partway through, it asks if you are a naturalized citizen, and, if you are, it asks you to upload a copy of your certificate of citizenship. My wife and I both have certificates, but the kid doesn't &#8211; she was naturalized along with my wife in 2021, and while my wife's certificate was sufficient to get our daughter a passport, it doesn't actually have the kid's name on it. I checked in with our lawyers and was told that the kid couldn't get her certificate of citizenship until she turned 18, which she did last Tuesday. My calendar reminded me that it was time to fill in her N-600, the form for applying for a certificate of citizenship. So yesterday, I sat down at the computer, cleared a couple hours, and went to work. I am used to gnarly bureaucratic questions on this kind of paperwork, and I confess I get a small thrill of victory whenever I can bring up an obscure document demanded by the form. For example: I was able to pull up the number of the passport our daughter used to enter the country in 2015, along with the flight number and date. I was able to pull up all three of the numbers that the US immigration service assigned to both my wife and me. And then, about two hours into this process, I got to this section of the form: \"U.S. citizen mother or father's physical presence.\" This section requires me to list every border crossing I made into the USA from the day I was born until the date I became a citizen. That includes, for example, the time when I was two years old and my parents took me to Fort Lauderdale to visit my retired grandparents. This question comes after a screen where you attest that you will not make any omissions or errors, and that any such omission or error will be treated as an attempt to defraud the US immigration system, with the most severe penalties imaginable. I tried to call the US immigration service's info line. It is now staffed exclusively by an AI chatbot (thanks, Elon). I tried a dozen times to get the chatbot to put me on the phone with a human who could confirm what I should do about visits to the US that I took more than 50 years ago, when I was two years old. But the chatbot would only offer to text me a link to the online form, which has no guidance on this subject. Then I tried the online chat, which is also answered by a chatbot. This chatbot only allows you to ask questions that are less than 80 characters long. Eventually, I managed to piece together a complete conversation with the chatbot that conveyed my question, and it gave me a link to the same online form. But there is an option to escalate the online chat from a bot to a human. So I tried that, and, after repeatedly being prompted to provide my full name and address (home address and mailing address), date of birth, phone number &#8211; and disconnected for not typing all this quickly enough &#8211; the human eventually pasted in boilerplate telling me to consult an immigration attorney and terminated the chat before I could reply. Just to be clear here: this is immigration on the easiest setting. I am an affluent native English speaker with access to immigration counsel at a fancy firm. Imagine instead that you are not as lucky as I am. Imagine that your parents brought you to the USA 60 years ago, and that you've been a citizen for more than half a century, but you're being told that you should carry your certificate of citizenship if you don't want to be shot in the face or kidnapped to a slave labor camp. Your parents &#8211; long dead &#8211; never got you that certificate, so you create an online ID with the immigration service and try to complete form N-600. Do you know the date and flight number for the plane you flew to America on when you were three? Do you know your passport number from back then? Do you have all three of each of your dead parents' numeric immigration identifiers? Can you recover the dates of every border crossing your parents made into the USA from the day they were born until the day they became citizens? Anyone who says that \"immigrants should just follow the rules\" has missed the fact that the rules are impossible to follow. I get to do luxury Kafka, the business class version of US immigration Kafka, where you get to board first and nibble from a dish of warm nuts while everyone else shuffles past you, and I've given up on getting my daughter's certificate of citizenship. The alternative &#8211; omitting a single American vacation between 1971 and 2022 &#8211; could constitute an attempt to defraud the US immigration system, after all. This was terrible a couple years ago, when the immigration system still had human operators you could reach by sitting on hold for several hours. Today, thanks to a single billionaire's gleeful cruelty, the system is literally unnavigable, \"staffed\" by a chatbot that can't answer basic questions. A timely reminder that the only jobs AI can do are the jobs that no one gives a shit about: https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/06/unmerchantable-substitute-goods/#customer-disservice It's also a timely reminder of the awesome destructive power of a single billionaire. This week, I took a Southwest flight to visit my daughter at college for her 18th birthday, and of course, SWA now charges for bags and seats. Multiple passengers complained bitterly and loudly about this as they boarded (despite the fact that the plane was only half full, many people were given middle seats and banned from moving to empty rows). One woman plaintively called out, \"Why does everything get worse all the time?\" (Yes, I'm aware of the irony of someone saying that within my earshot): https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/14/pearl-clutching/#this-toilet-has-no-central-nervous-system Southwest sucks today because of just one guy: Paul Singer, the billionaire owner of Elliott Investment Management, who bought a stake in SWA and used it to force the board to end open seating and free bag-check, then sold off his stake and disappeared into the sunset, millions richer, leaving behind a pile of shit where a beloved airline once flew: https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2024/10/24/southwest-airlines-bends-to-activist-investor-restructures-board/ One guy, Elon Musk, took the immigration system from \"frustrating and inefficient\" to \"totally impossible.\" That same guy is an avowed white nationalist &#8211; and illegal US immigrant who did cheat the immigration system &#8211; who sadistically celebrates the unlimited cruelty the immigration system heaps on other immigrants: https://www.congress.gov/119/meeting/house/118277/documents/HHRG-119-JU13-20250520-SD003.pdf Again: I've got it easy. The people they want to put in concentration camps are doing something a million times harder than anything I've had to do to become a US citizen. People sometimes joke about how Americans couldn't pass the US citizenship test, with its questions about the tortured syntax of the 10th Amendment and the different branches of government. But the US citizenship test is the easy part. That test sits at the center of a bureaucratic maze that no American could find their way through. Hey look at this (permalink) The Big Idea: Justin C.

In the midst of massive national protests, the government shut down the internet, phone calls, and almost all communication out of the country. That evening a violent crackdown began. In some cities, government forces opened fire on crowds, killing thousands – <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/jan/27/iran-protests-death-toll-disappeared-bodies-mass-burials-30000-dead\">according to some estimates</a>, possibly tens of thousands – in two days of bloodshed. The internet blackout has meant that a clearer picture of what happened – drawn from witness reports, videos, photographs and testimony from hospitals – has taken time to assemble.</p><p>When the violence began, there were demonstrations taking place in more than 200 cities, according to human rights groups. This is the story of what unfolded in one of them.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/ng-interactive/2026/feb/06/rasht-massacre-protests-iran-timeline\">Continue reading...</a>",

Not as a Valve-supported program for manufacturers to create living room PCs, but instead a home console sibling to the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/steam-deck-lcd-review-2023-still-one-of-the-best-handheld-pcs-140044516.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Deck</a>. Valve introduced its second attempt at ruling the living room in a surprise hardware announcement in November 2025, and paired the new <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-announces-new-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-182836847.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Machine</a> with a new Steam Controller and a wireless VR headset it calls the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/valves-steam-frame-vr-headset-is-finally-official-and-its-coming-in-2026-181909387.html\" target=\"_blank\">Steam Frame</a>. Since the announcement, as is often the case with Valve, some details remain elusive, however.</p><p>While we wait for the release of the company's new hardware lineup in 2026, and more information straight from the horse's mouth, here's everything we know about the hardware, software and price of the Steam Machine.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-steam-machines-hardware-like\">What's the Steam Machine's hardware like?</h2><figure><img alt=\"A line-drawing diagram of the Steam Machine and its various ports.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Steam-Machine-diagram.jpg\" style=\"height: 1440px; width: 2560px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Valve</div></figure><p>Like the Steam Deck, the Steam Machine is utilitarian and bespoke. The PC is a black, 5.98 x 6.39 x 6.14 inch (152 x 162.4 x 156mm) box, with ports and a grille for a fan in the back and a removable faceplate and customizable LED light strip in the front. Inside, Valve says the Steam Machine features a &quot;semi-custom&quot; AMD Zen 4 CPU with six cores and up to 4.8GHz clock speeds, and a &quot;semi-custom&quot; RDNA3 AMD GPU, along with 16GB DDR RAM, 8GB GDDR6 VRAM and either 512GB or 2TB of storage.</p><p>While these specs make the Steam Machine more powerful than the aging Steam Deck (which shipped in 2022 with its own custom AMD chip) Valve has been careful not to oversell the capabilities of the box. In <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/45479024/view/625565405086220583?l=english\" target=\"_blank\">a blog post</a>, the company said that &quot;the majority of Steam titles play great at 4K 60FPS&quot; using AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) frame generation and upscaling technology, but some titles require more upscaling than others, and it &quot;may be preferable to play at a lower framerate with [variable refresh rate] to maintain a 1080p internal resolution.&quot;</p><p>In a hands-on preview of the Steam Machine, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.digitalfoundry.net/features/hands-on-with-steam-machine-valves-new-pcconsole-hybrid\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a> expressed concern with what Valve's claims and the device's stated specs could mean for future performance. &quot;The decision to opt for 8GB of GDDR6 memory has been proven to be a limiting factor on many modern mainstream triple-A games and falls short of the maximum VRAM pools and memory bandwidth available on both Xbox Series X and base PS5,&quot; <em>Digital Foundry </em>writes.</p><p>The Steam Machine supports Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 6E and includes an integrated 2.4GHz adapter for the new Steam Controller. In terms of port selection, there's DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 inputs for connecting the box to external monitors and TVs, four USB-A ports (divided between two USB 2.0 ports and two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports) and one USB-C port on the back.</p><p>Engadget will have to try out&nbsp;the Steam Machine to really know what it's capable of, but there's nothing to suggest it couldn't be as flexible as the Steam Deck, especially with more power to play with.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-games-will-be-able-to-run-on-the-steam-machine\">What games will be able to run on the Steam Machine?</h2><figure><img alt=\"A Steam Machine connected to a TV playing the game Cuphead.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Steam-Machine-over-the-shoulder.jpg\" style=\"height: 4320px; width: 7680px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Valve</div></figure><p>Any game that runs on SteamOS, Valve's Linux-based operating system, will run on the Steam Machine, provided the device's technical specs will support it. For games running natively on Linux, the Steam Machine will download the Linux version. For Windows games and everything else, it'll be able to use Steam's built-in Proton compatibility layer to translate games to Linux, just like the Steam Deck does.</p><p>Proton is developed by both Valve and CodeWeavers, the team behind the macOS compatibility app <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover\" target=\"_blank\">CrossOver</a>. Valve's compatibility layer translates a game's API calls and other software features into something Linux understands, essentially tricking the game into thinking it's running on Windows when it isn't. Proton has worked remarkably well so far, in some cases helping some PC games run more efficiently on Linux than they do on Windows, but it does have some limitations. Because some anti-cheat software <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/for-the-steam-machine-to-change-pc-gaming-valve-must-solve-linuxs-anti-cheat-problem-130000088.html\" target=\"_blank\">doesn't support Linux</a>, many competitive multiplayer games aren't playable on SteamOS. Valve hopes the Steam Machine will help change that.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;While [the] Steam Machine also requires dev participation to enable anti-cheat, we think the incentives for enabling anti-cheat on Machine to be higher than on Deck as we expect more people to play multiplayer games on it,&quot; Valve <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.eurogamer.net/will-battlefield-6-work-on-steam-machine-valve-hopes-its-new-hardware-will-prompt-a-fresh-discussion-with-developers-over-kernel-level-anti-cheat\" target=\"_blank\">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. &quot;Ultimately we hope that the launch of Machine will change the equation around anti-cheat support and increase its support.&quot;</p><p>To help users find what games work well on the Steam Machine, Valve plans to expand its program for verifying games on the Steam Deck to include the Steam Machine and Steam Frame. Valve looks at things like controller support, the default resolution of the game, whether or not it requires a separate launcher and whether the game and its middleware work with Proton to determine a game's rating. Then the company sorts games into four categories: Verified (where the game works with Steam hardware at launch), Playable (where a user might have to make modifications to run smoothly), Unplayable (where some or all of the game doesn't function) and Unknown.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/563639634283728255\" target=\"_blank\">an announcement</a> Valve sent to developers, games that were Verified for the Steam Deck will automatically be verified for the Steam Machine. The system is helpful, but far from definitive — some Unplayable games are in fact playable — which is why online, community-run databases like <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.protondb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ProtonDB</a> fill in the gaps with more granular information.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-much-will-the-steam-machine-cost-and-when-will-it-launch\">How much will the Steam Machine cost and when will it launch?</h2><figure><img alt=\"A Steam Machine with an LED strip displaying the current download progress of a game.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Steam-Machine-led-strip.jpg\" style=\"height: 4320px; width: 7680px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Valve</div></figure><p>Valve hasn't announced a price or a release date for the Steam Machine or any of its new hardware. In terms of price, however, the company has suggested it might not be a deal in quite the same way the $399 Steam Deck LCD was. Valve designer Pierre-Loup Griffais told <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Verge</em></a> that the &quot;Steam Machine’s pricing is comparable to a PC with similar specs&quot; and that its price would be &quot;positioned closer to the entry level of the PC space&quot; but be &quot;very competitive with what you a PC you could build yourself from parts.&quot;</p><p>That means the Steam Machine will likely cost more than the $499 PS5, and that the rising costs of memory could make it even more expensive. Valve has already publicly admitted that memory and storage shortages are affecting its plans. In February, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/valve-pushes-back-steam-machine-launch-due-to-storage-and-memory-shortage-133000103.html\" target=\"_blank\">the company said</a> that it was delaying the launch of its hardware (though it still hopes to ship in the first half of 2026) and rethinking pricing, particularly around the Steam Machine and Steam Frame, because of the &quot;limited availability and growing prices&quot; of critical components like RAM.</p><p>The changes Framework had to make to the pricing of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/framework-builds-its-own-modular-desktop-191211936.html\" target=\"_blank\">Framework Desktop</a> are an illustrative example of the position Valve is in. Framework pitched its compact desktop PC as being great for gaming, with an AMD Ryzen AI Max chip (originally meant for gaming laptops) and a minimum of 32GB of RAM that lets it run games at 1440p. The company originally sold the base configuration of the Framework Desktop for $1,099, but <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/framework-increases-desktop-prices-by-up-to-460-due-to-ram-crisis-234827145.html\" target=\"_blank\">announced in January 2026</a> that it would now cost $1,139 due to the rising cost of RAM. The price situation got even worse for configurations with more RAM. A Framework Desktop with 128GB of RAM now costs $2,459.</p><p>The blame for rising costs lies squarely with the AI industry, whose demand for RAM has led to the collapse of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/crucial-is-a-casualty-of-ais-hunger-for-ram-185910113.html\" target=\"_blank\">consumer RAM brands</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/there-arent-any-black-friday-deals-on-ram-this-year-and-you-can-thank-ai-for-that-130000335.html\" target=\"_blank\">a dearth of true deals</a> on the in-demand component. At this point, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/ces-2026-proved-the-pc-industry-is-hosed-this-year-174500314.html\" target=\"_blank\">PC makers have no solution to the problem</a> other than riding the shortage out and raising prices. Valve clearly isn't immune to those same issues.</p><p>That doesn't rule out the company offering its Linux PC at multiple different price points, or in some kind of bundle deal with multiple pieces of new Steam hardware. But it does mean that the Steam Machine will likely be priced like a premium device. Same for the Steam Controller and Steam Frame. In the case of the Frame, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.uploadvr.com/valve-steam-frame-hands-on-impressions/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>UploadVR</em></a> reports that Valve wants to sell the headset for less than the $1,000 Valve Index, but that doesn't mean it won't be significantly more expensive than the $300 <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-quest-3s-review-impressive-vr-for-300-130013596.html\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Quest 3S</a>.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-accessories-will-work-with-the-steam-machine\">What accessories will work with the Steam Machine?</h2><figure><img alt=\"Someone holding a Steam Controller in a pile of plushies.\" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/Steam-Controller.jpg\" style=\"height: 4320px; width: 7680px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Valve</div></figure><p>The Steam Machine is designed to work with a variety of different Bluetooth controllers and other wireless accessories, and also whatever you can plug into its multiple USB-A ports and single USB-C port. With a built-in 2.4GHz Steam Controller dongle inside the Steam Machine, Valve's controller should be an ideal option for controlling games, particularly because of its multiple control options, like touchpads and gyroscopes. Support for Steam Link, Valve's tech for streaming PC games over local wireless, means you can also send games from a Steam Machine to the Steam Deck, Steam Frame or the Steam Link app and play them there.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/everything-we-know-about-valves-new-steam-machine-200458817.html?src=rss",
