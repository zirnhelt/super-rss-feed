On the other end of the spectrum, Gurman's <em>Power On</em> newsletter mentioned that Apple is considering a larger foldable that opens like a book. Previously, Gurman said that Apple considered a foldable that's more akin to the size of an iPad. However, the company ran into issues developing such a large device and may be delaying a <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-21/apple-s-planned-foldable-ipad-with-18-inch-screen-hits-development-snags\">potential launch</a> to 2029, according to Gurman.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-already-thinking-about-its-second-foldable-iphone-and-it-may-be-a-clamshell-202312700.html?src=rss",

Compared to the previous design that allowed you to pick between several prebuilt options, the new configurator lets you choose one spec after another instead.</p>\n<p>It's not a major difference compared to choosing between preconfigured options, but interested buyers have more customization since they can select the color, display, chip, memory, storage and even power adapter. The updated page also gives customers the option to add pre-installed apps, like Final Cut Pro or Logic Pro, to their new Mac.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The updated configuration design might hint towards the expected release of the upgraded MacBook Pros.

The country's Ministry of Communication and Digital Affairs released <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.komdigi.go.id/berita/siaran-pers/detail/kemkomdigi-awasi-ketat-normalisasi-grok-usai-x-sampaikan-komitmen-kepatuhan\">a statement</a> earlier today, which said X is allowed to resume service in Indonesia but will be subject to monitoring for any future violations.</p>\n<p>According to the Indonesian government agency, X provided a letter that detailed several implemented measures that prevent the misuse of its Grok chatbot. Alexander Sabar, the ministry’s director general of digital space supervision, said in the statement that the agency will test the new measures on an ongoing basis and will ban Grok again if it's found spreading illegal content or violating the country's laws regarding children.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The issue dates back to earlier this year, when Indonesia, along with Malaysia and the Philippines, <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7y10xm4x2o\">banned the AI chatbot</a> after it was found producing sexually explicit deepfake images of women and children without their consent in response to user requests. Later that month, the Philippines lifted its ban on Grok, followed by <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/malaysia-lifts-ban-on-grok-after-taking-x-at-its-word-144457468.html\">Malaysia</a> doing the same just a couple of days after. Similar to Indonesia, Malaysian authorities said they will continue to monitor Grok and threatened more enforcement actions if the AI chatbot repeats its past offenses. Beyond the bans, Grok is also facing investigations from California's <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/california-is-investigating-grok-over-ai-generated-csam-and-nonconsensual-deepfakes-202029635.html\">attorney general</a> and the UK's <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-regulator-ofcom-opens-a-formal-investigation-into-x-over-csam-scandal-120000312.html\">media regulator</a> concerning the same issue.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/indonesia-is-lifting-its-ban-on-grok-but-with-some-conditions-175305634.html?src=rss",

Once the battery is seated correctly, the AirTag will emit a brief chime, confirming that power has been restored.</p></li><li><p>Place the battery cover back onto the AirTag. Align the three small tabs on the cover with the matching slots on the AirTag body.</p></li><li><p>Press down gently and rotate the cover clockwise until it stops. The cover should sit flush with the AirTag and feel secure once locked into place.</p></li></ol><p>No pairing or setup steps are required after replacing the battery. Your AirTag will automatically reconnect to your Apple ID.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-to-replace-your-airtag-battery\">When to replace your AirTag battery</h2><p>Your iPhone will automatically notify you when an AirTag battery is running low. The alert appears as a notification and doesn’t interrupt tracking, but it’s a good idea to replace the battery quickly to avoid losing location updates.</p><p>If you’re unsure whether your AirTag battery needs replacing, open the <strong>Find My app</strong>, tap the <strong>Items</strong> tab and select your <strong>AirTag</strong>. If a message appears under the AirTag name stating “Low Battery”, you’ll know it needs replacing. If no message appears, it’s safe to assume the battery level is fine for now. AirTags don’t have a screen or any other battery indicator, but Apple does show a battery percentage for AirTags in the FindMy app. The low battery warning is the only signal Apple provides before replacement becomes necessary.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-do-if-your-airtag-doesnt-make-a-sound\">What to do if your AirTag doesn’t make a sound</h2><p>If you don’t hear a sound after inserting the new battery, remove it and check that it’s oriented correctly with the positive side facing up. You should also secure the back cover onto the AirTag as well, to see if the chime sounds after that.</p><p>If the battery is oriented properly and still doesn’t trigger a sound, try a different CR2032 battery. AirTag uses a CR2032 lithium 3V coin battery, a common type available at most electronics stores, supermarkets and pharmacies. Some batteries, particularly those with thick coatings, may not make consistent contact. Apple suggests looking for packaging that states “Compatible with AirTag.” Once a working battery is installed, the AirTag should resume normal operation immediately.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-often-should-you-replace-your-airtag-battery\">How often should you replace your AirTag battery</h2><p>Most AirTag batteries last about a year under typical use. Frequent use of Precision Finding, sound playback or location updates may reduce battery life. iOS will notify you before the battery is fully depleted, so there’s no need to replace it preemptively unless you’re preparing for long-term travel or storage.</p><p>Used coin batteries should not be thrown in household trash. Many retailers and recycling centers accept lithium batteries for proper disposal. Check local recycling guidelines for battery drop-off locations. Storing used batteries in a secure container until they can be recycled helps reduce the risk of accidental contact or ingestion.</p><p>Replacing an AirTag battery is one of the simplest maintenance tasks Apple devices require. With a readily available battery and no tools involved, most users can complete the process in under a minute. As long as you pay attention to low battery notifications and follow basic safety precautions, your AirTag should continue tracking your belongings reliably with minimal effort.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html?src=rss",

The 4.2-inch LCD screen has a resolution of 1,280 x 960 and is flanked by Hall effect joysticks with RGB lighting, Hall effect triggers and &quot;crystal-textured&quot; buttons.

On Friday, SpaceX <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://fccprod.servicenowservices.com/icfs?id=ibfs_application_summary&amp;number=SAT-LOA-20260108-00016\">filed an application</a> with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to launch a million satellites meant to create an &quot;orbital data center.&quot; This isn't the first time we're hearing of Musk's plans to build an orbital data center, as it was mentioned by company insiders following the news that the CEO was reportedly preparing to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/elon-musk-is-reportedly-trying-to-take-spacex-public-170337053.html\">take SpaceX public</a>.</p>\n<p>According to the filing spotted by <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-eyes-1-million-satellites-for-orbital-data-center-push?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&amp;test_variant=B\"><em>PCMag</em></a>, this data center would run off solar power and deliver computing capacity for <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musks-spacex-and-xai-are-reportedly-holding-merger-talks-211740150.html\">artificial intelligence needs</a>. SpaceX is requesting to &quot;deploy a system of up to one million satellites to operate within narrow orbital shells spanning up to 50 km each,&quot; as detailed in the filing. According to SpaceX's filing, &quot;orbital data centers are the most efficient way to meet the accelerating demand for AI computing power&quot; since they use &quot;solar power with little operating and maintenance costs.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>To give some scale of the astronomical number of satellites SpaceX is asking for, the company recently hit a milestone of the 11,000th Starlink satellite launched. There aren't as many in orbit since the satellites can run into issues, but an <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://planet4589.org/space/con/star/stats.html\">unofficial website</a> that tracks Starlink stats claims there are more than 9,600 satellites in orbit as of January 30, 2026. The FCC is likely to whittle down the amount that SpaceX is asking for in its filing, as the federal agency has done in the past. Earlier this month, the FCC approved <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-can-deploy-7500-more-starlink-gen2-satellites-with-fcc-approval-180000843.html\">SpaceX's request</a> to deploy 7,500 more Starlink satellites, following another 7,500 launched in 2022. However, it's much less than the nearly 30,000 amount that SpaceX first asked for in 2020.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-wants-to-launch-a-constellation-of-a-million-satellites-to-power-ai-needs-175607771.html?src=rss",
