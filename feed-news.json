It can save you time and money, too, compared to buying PC components piecemeal. If you’re weighing your options, consider some Presidents Day offers on iBuyPower’s pre-built desktops, including the $1,899 RDY Element 9 Pro R07 and the $2,099.99 Slate — both of which are stocked [&#8230;]",

New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=85d85ef3-fac9-418f-9573-418cf162cd0c&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=c4b6e8a2-981f-4fc9-b476-d49dcaeed4ba&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Disney%2B&amp;linkText=Disney%2B+Hulu+bundle&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNuZXlwbHVzLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImM0YjZlOGEyLTk4MWYtNGZjOS1iNDc2LWQ0OWRjYWVlZDRiYSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGlzbmV5cGx1cy5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAYlgNIZqhCWI5a9GYTTCBjANZc2imSHnwOrLtdthLEQF&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F\">Disney+ Hulu bundle</a> for just $10. That's $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).</p> \n<p>We'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>Disney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/disney-and-hulu-deal-get-the-bundle-for-10-for-one-month-192814789.html?src=rss",

This is a record-low price, as it drops $62 from the price tag. The sale applies to all three colorways.</p> \n<p>These easily topped our list of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">best wireless headphones</a>. They are, in a word, fantastic. The headphones are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review-the-best-headphones-just-keep-on-getting-better-160058170.html\">packed with premium features</a>, like advanced ANC. There are a whopping 12 ANC microphones throughout and a brand-new chip to power the feature. The end result? It successfully blocks background noise at medium and high frequencies, including the human voice.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>The sound quality is extremely pleasing to the ears, thanks to new audio drivers and a team of mastering engineers that assisted with tuning. There are perforations in the driver's voice coil, which extends high frequency reproduction.</p> \n<p>The design has been upgraded from the previous iteration and we found them extremely comfortable to wear for long periods of time, which is important with headphones. The battery gets around 30 hours, which is a fairly standard metric for this type of thing.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The only real major nitpick here is the original asking price. It's tough to recommend any pair of headphones for $460, but a bit easier at under $400.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/grab-our-favorite-wireless-headphones-while-theyre-on-sale-for-an-all-time-low-price-175038719.html?src=rss",

The second-gen model that Apple just released <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\">outpaces the original</a> in every way (aside from the galling lack of a keyring hole, that is). While it's easy enough to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html\">replace the battery</a> in both versions of the AirTag, you might not want to have to worry about the device's battery life for a very long time.

It's not the first time <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-extended-battery-airtag-case-is-down-to-only-16-162308748.html\">we've seen this deal</a>, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This is arguably one of the more useful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag accessories</a> around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> \n<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> \n<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/this-elevation-lab-airtag-10-year-extended-battery-case-is-on-sale-for-only-16-right-now-151215739.html?src=rss",

Homeland Security asked the companies for names, email addresses, telephone numbers and any other identifying detail for accounts that have criticized the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency or have reported the location of its agents. Google, Meta and Reddit have  complied with some of the requests</p><p>Administrative subpoenas are different from warrants and are issued by the DHS. <em>The Times</em> says they were rarely used in the past and were mostly sent to companies for the investigation of serious crimes, such as child trafficking. Apparently, though, the government has ramped up its use in the past year. “It’s a whole other level of frequency and lack of accountability,” Steve Loney, a senior supervising attorney for ACLU, told the publication. </p><p>Companies can choose whether to comply with the authorities or not, and some of them give the subject of a subpoena up to 14 days to fight it in court. Google told <em>The Times</em> that its review process for government requests is “ designed to protect user privacy while meeting [its] legal obligations” and that it informs users when their accounts have been subpoenaed unless it has been legally ordered not to or in exceptional circumstances. “We review every legal demand and push back against those that are overbroad,” the company said. </p><p>Some of the accounts that were subpoenaed belong to users posting ICE activity in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Facebook and Instagram in English and Spanish. The DHS asked Meta for their names and details on September 11, and the users were notified about it on October 3. They were told that if Meta didn’t receive documentation that they were fighting the subpoena in court within 10 days, Meta will give Homeland Security the information it was asking for. The ACLU filed a motion for the users in court, arguing that the DHS is using administrative subpoenas as a tool to suppress speech of people it didn’t agree with. </p><p>In late January, Meta started <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-blocks-links-to-ice-list-a-wiki-that-names-agents-231410653.html\" target=\"_blank\">blocking links to ICE List</a>, a website that lists thousands of ICE and Border Patrol agents’ names.

A whole bunch of compelling games arrived this week, and Sony dropped some news about more that are on the way to PS5 and other platforms during its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-watch-playstations-hour-long-state-of-play-and-what-to-expect-162128585.html\" target=\"_blank\">State of Play stream on Thursday</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>For one thing, I didn’t have a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/a-neva-prequel-is-arriving-next-week-081239628.html\" target=\"_blank\">prequel for <em>Neva</em></a>, one of my favorite games of the last few years on my bingo card. I’m very much looking forward to checking out that DLC next week.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>It’s really neat that Motion Twin and Evil Empire — the studios behind <em>Dead Cells</em> and its expansions, respectively — are getting to make a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/dead-cells-castlevania-dlc-trailer-release-window-012349322.html\" target=\"_blank\">proper Castlevania game</a>. While it might not be developing many games in-house anymore, giving external studios the chance to run with its franchises is a very smart move on Konami’s part. Not least because we’re getting a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/silent-hill-townfall-takes-the-series-trademark-fog-to-an-eerie-coastal-community-233324897.html\" target=\"_blank\">Silent Hill game set in Scotland as well</a>.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>I’ve had<em> Big Walk</em> on my radar since the game was first shown off <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-walk-is-the-next-project-from-the-untitled-goose-game-team-014503842.html\" target=\"_blank\">at The Game Awards a couple of years back</a>. This is a co-op multiplayer game from <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> studio House House and publisher Panic in which you'll go on adventures with your friends and help each other through puzzles and other challenges using voice, text chat and gestures. You can just hang out with your buds and watch the sunset or put their binoculars into the ocean too.</p><p>Expect <em>Big Walk</em> to arrive later this year on PS5 (including as a Monthly Game for all PS Plus members), Steam and Epic Games Store. There will be support for cross-platform play between PS5 and PC.</p><p>Also, Remedy Entertainment is technically an indie studio. As such, I can mention here that I cannot wait for <em>Control Resonant</em>, which is probably going to break my brain with all the perspective shifting Remedy showed off in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/the-first-control-resonant-gameplay-trailer-shows-dylan-defying-physics-in-a-sideways-nyc-224746545.html\" target=\"_blank\">the gameplay trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-new-releases\">New releases</h2><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>As with any successful heist, planning and execution are equally paramount in <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/rescue-african-artifacts-from-colonizers-museums-in-the-heist-game-relooted-000035161.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Relooted</em></a>. Setting things up properly before hightailing it out of a museum with artifacts reminds me a bit of <em>Teardown</em> albeit without all the voxel destruction. But <em>Relooted</em> is a lot more than that.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s an anti-colonialist story in which parkour enthusiast Nomali and her crew take back African artifacts (all of which exist in real life) from Western museums. I did encounter some performance issues while playing on PC, but that didn't take too much away from the enjoyable, in-the-moment action and having to adjust escape routes on the fly when things go awry. Nor did the framerate drops detract one bit from the important story that South African studio Nyamakop is telling here.</p><p><em>Relooted </em>is out now on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/relooted-89fdd7\" target=\"_blank\">Epic Games Store</a> and <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=5f41950e-8ca3-4481-8466-a22b28b80e32&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=6ffef56b-cf61-4e51-b729-b51fe5f828a9&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Xbox&amp;linkText=Xbox+Series+X%2FS&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy54Ym94LmNvbS9lbi1VUy9nYW1lcy9zdG9yZS9yZWxvb3RlZC85cHBwNTM0NGIzbHMiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjZmZmVmNTZiLWNmNjEtNGU1MS1iNzI5LWI1MWZlNWY4MjhhOSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueGJveC5jb20vZW4tVVMvZ2FtZXMvc3RvcmUvcmVsb290ZWQvOXBwcDUzNDRiM2xzIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUVLf7VY__JniAzAb0NzQAwzjMV2IK4G3SSylF-wCMTp&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Frelooted%2F9ppp5344b3ls\" target=\"_blank\">Xbox Series X/S</a>.

It was initially announced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-16-latest-mew-genics-teaser-collects-trinkets-with-magic-propertie.html\" target=\"_blank\">in 2012</a> when co-developer Edmund McMillen was still part of <em>Super Meat Boy </em>studio Team Meat. After years of <em>Mewgenics </em>being in development hell amid McMillen focusing on projects such as <em>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</em>, he's finally seen the game through with the help of longtime collaborator Tyler Glaiel.</p><p>This is a turn-based strategy roguelike in which players breed cats and then take kitties with wild mutations and blends of powers into combat. There's a lot to explore and discover here. McMillen and Glaiel claim the main campaign runs for over 200 hours. Having more than 10&nbsp;character classes (each with 75 unique abilities), more than 900 items and hundreds of bosses and enemies could well ensure that things stay fresh enough to justify that run time.</p><p>Reviews have largely been positive for this one, though the humor didn't click for some critics. <em>Mewgenics </em>is out now on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>. It usually costs $30, but you can save $3 if you buy it by February 24.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>Rogue Point </em>is a co-op shooter for up to four players that’s worth paying attention to, in large part because it’s from the team behind <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-black-mesa-the-fan-made-half-life-remake-finally-has-a-rel.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Black Mesa</em></a>, the fan remake of <em>Half-Life</em>. It's now available in early access on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>, typically for $20, though there's a 15 percent discount until February 26.</p><p>This appears to be in the vein of tactical shooters like Ubisoft's Tom Clancy games. There are objective-based missions and a Counter-Strike-style economy for unlocking and upgrading gear. While there are only four maps as things stand, Crowbar Collective has implemented a system that randomizes the layouts to keep things fresh.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-upcoming\">Upcoming&nbsp;</h2><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Steam Next Fest is almost upon us. Many developers and publishers are preparing to release demos for their games, but some are arriving ahead of the event, such as one for <em>Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!</em> The demo is a blast and it feels like the kind of retro <em>Starship Troopers</em> shooter I wish we'd had in the late '90s.&nbsp;</p><p>I really enjoy <em>Helldivers 2</em>, which takes a lot of inspiration from <em>Starship Troopers</em>. In turn, this game draws from <em>Helldivers 2</em>, with features like tossing a flare to tell a support craft to send gear down to the planet's surface. I just wish the mech was a bit more fun and effective to use.</p><p>If you would like to know more about this game from <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em> developer Auroch Digital and publisher Dotemu, you can check out the demo on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4307720/Starship_Troopers_Ultimate_Bug_War__Demo/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a>. <em>Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War! </em>is coming to Steam, GOG, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch 2 on March 16.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>A demo for a line-based puzzle title called <em>Rope </em>popped up on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4329270/Rope_Demo/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> this week ahead of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3866170/Rope/\" target=\"_blank\">full game's arrival</a> in April for about $3.50. The aim is to connect ropes of the same color to clear them. More rules will be introduced over time to make the game more challenging.</p><p>While <em>Rope</em> looks charming enough, I mainly wanted to include it in this week’s roundup because I thought developer Ikuo's comments in the press release were quite lovely.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;My games are neither flashy nor extravagant. Instead, I focus on preserving the essence of play. Like hide‑and‑seek or tag — simple rules that draw you in until you forget the time,&quot; Ikuo said. &quot;<em>Rope </em>brings that timeless spirit of play into a modern puzzle game. It is intuitive, endlessly replayable and quietly absorbing. I aimed to create a small, understated experience that stays with players long after they put it down. I hope this game leaves even a small impression on someone’s heart.&quot;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p><em>The Mermaid Mask </em>is a project that SFB Games put on the backburner after another one of their games became a hit (that would be <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/crow-country-is-a-darkly-meditative-callback-to-survival-horrors-past-130041405.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Crow Country</em></a>, which was one of our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/engadgets-games-of-the-year-2024-133005519.html\" target=\"_blank\">favorite games of 2024</a>). </p><p>This point-and-click puzzle game is the latest installment in the long-running Detective Grimoire series<em>.&nbsp;</em>A teaser trailer doesn't give away too much, but I do enjoy what we see of the hand-drawn 2D animation here. </p><p>Here's hoping this is a worthy follow-up to <em>Tangle Tower</em>, an Apple Arcade game <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-apple-arcade-best-games.html\" target=\"_blank\">we enjoyed very much</a>. We'll find out for sure when <em>The Mermaid Mask </em>lands on PC and consoles this summer. In the meantime, you can check out an updated demo that just hit <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1696770/The_Mermaid_Mask/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> ahead of Next Fest.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>The premise of<em> The Stairwell</em> is practically identical to that of <em>The Exit 8</em>. You walk through a small, contained scene multiple times. If everything looks okay, keep walking forward. If something is out of the ordinary, you turn around. Just try not to miss many anomalies. Rather than walk through corridors as in <em>The Exit 8</em> (the film adaptation of which <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlRQ1oatOt8\" target=\"_blank\">looks pretty promising</a>), <em>The Stairwell</em> sees you going up or down a seemingly infinite tower as you try to reach the goal.&nbsp;</p><p>This anomaly game, which is from Hidden Palace, has been on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/3578120/The_Stairwell/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> since last year. It’s coming to PS5 on February 19. Expect jump scares.&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Let's wrap things up for this week with an arcade game that requires just two inputs: one button to turn left, and another to veer right. You can't control the speed of your craft in <em>Ship v Maze</em>. All you can do to avoid crashing and ending your run is to react quickly enough to steer your ship through various obstacles. It's all about putting your reflexes to the test.</p><p><em>Ship v Maze </em>is from Cosmic Droplet (aka solo developer Frederic Vanmol), It'll hit <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113380/Ship_v_Maze/\" target=\"_blank\">Steam</a> on April 2 for $4. A demo is available now.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/relooted-reanimal-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000234.html?src=rss",

There are four available games to play, including <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em>.</p>\n<p>These aren't new VR builds of the games, rather they are the versions previously released for the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-26-nintendo-labo-review.html\">Nintendo Labo</a> VR set. This was a kit for the original Switch that allowed users to build a cardboard VR headset, among other items.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"cb0a072feed84ecc954d160d9d366b4f\"></div>\n<p>However, this is very good news for Switch 2 owners as Labo creations generally don't work with Nintendo's shiny new console. So this is the only way to experience the VR versions of the aforementioned four games. It's also worth noting that the Switch 2 upgrade for <em>Breath of the Wild</em> still includes the VR mode.</p>\n<p>There are some caveats. The Virtual Boy accessory is available to purchase as a hardware unit or in cardboard. The cardboard version is much cheaper, at $25, and is actually the preferred method for playing these games in VR.</p>\n<p>That's because the hardware version sits on a stand, like the original Virtual Boy, making it harder to move one's head around. The cardboard headset is free from those constraints. The hardware also includes red filters over the lenses, to better mimic the original experience, but these can be removed.</p>\n<p>However, the hardware version is better for playing actual Virtual Boy games, as they were designed for a static headset resting on a table. You'll have to decide if that trade-off is worth $100. It's also worth noting that Virtual Boy games <a href=\"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-clarifies-that-labo-vr-will-not-work-with-virtual-boy-for-switch-online\">will not work with the original Labo VR headset</a>, which is a bummer for OG Switch fans.</p>\n<div id=\"098320bb4af8469baa2f32343ef4b3c1\"></div>\n<p>Both versions of the Virtual Boy accessories <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-is-bringing-back-the-virtual-boy-as-a-switch-and-switch-2-accessory-140037508.html\">will be available on February 17</a>, which is the same day several of the retro console's games head to the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription service. They can be <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829\">purchased at the My Nintendo Store</a>. We got a chance to try the headset and came away fairly impressed, though noted that the revamped accessory is &quot;just as eccentric and ungainly as the original was three decades ago.&quot;</p>\n<p>For those wondering what all the fuss is about, the Virtual Boy was an actual console released by Nintendo all the way back in 1995. It was one of the first mass-market VR devices and, as such, was decades ahead of the curve. It was cumbersome, the games were only in red and there was nothing by way of motion control. Americans only got 14 games before the console was discontinued.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-virtual-boy-accessory-lets-you-play-vr-mario-and-zelda-on-switch-2-172138483.html?src=rss",

Its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now: the Advanced tier is on sale for $88 for two years, plus four additional free months. The Basic plan is where you'll see the biggest discount: it's $68 for two years, plus the same four additional free months.</p> \n<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html\">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> \n<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/expressvpn-deal-two-year-plans-are-up-to-81-percent-off-right-now-180602064.html?src=rss",

But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day.

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

I understand that the pull of treating this social space just like other social spaces is strong, but we&#8217;re trying to do something different here&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>In the meantime, I&#8217;ve updated and refreshed <a href=\"https://kottke.org/threads/guidelines\">the community guidelines</a>; if you are going to participate in comments threads here, I would appreciate you reading it. (Quick reminder: you need to be a <a href=\"https://kottke.org/members/\">KDO member</a> to comment.)</p>\n\t<p>Instead of going over the guidelines here, I thought it might be helpful to share some examples of what I would consider good comments &#038; threads:</p>\n\t<p>👏 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/12/the-lies-and-falsifications-of-oliver-sacks#cmt-13588\">Margaret M&#8217;s comment</a> on The Lies and Falsifications of Oliver Sacks (it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/12/the-lies-and-falsifications-of-oliver-sacks\">a good thread</a> in general); an excerpt:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a doctor. It&#8217;s my second career; I was a book editor before. Naturally, when I decided to go back to school to pursue medicine, I read all sorts of books by doctors about taking care of their patients. Obviously, I read everything he wrote (for a general audience, anyway).</p>\n\t<p>This is such a betrayal.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>🙌 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/01/core-memories-with-the-swiftie-dads#cmt-13739\">Stuart Kern&#8217;s comment</a> on Core Memories With the Swiftie Dads; an excerpt:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Got time for a lengthy Worst Dad Ever Goes to See Taylor Swift story?</p>\n\t<p>2018 Taylor Swift tour. I take joy in what brings either of my two daughters joy. Happy to take my 17 year old daughter to see Taylor Swift. It involved snakes for some reason.</p>\n\t<p>Months in advance she camps out online and scores two tickets. Days out she decorates a t-shirt. Concert day she gets home from school, paints her face. We sit in traffic for two hours to get to the stadium. She floats across the acres of parking lot, grooving on the scene. We get to the gate.</p>\n\t<p>&#8220;These tickets were for last night.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>👍 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/11/whats-all-the-fuss-about-pluribus\">Both discussions</a> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/12/are-we-still-loving-pluribus\">about Pluribus</a> — perfect posts for folks to express opinions. And so many people thoughtfully disagreeing with me and each other with kindness &#038; respect.</p>\n\t<p>😊 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/12/0048104-oh-this-is-devilisha-game\">The thread about the &#8220;devilish&#8221; 2025 game</a>. Quick comments work here — everyone understood the vibe of the thread.</p>\n\t<p>🎯 <a href=\"https://kottke.org/25/10/playing-boards-of-canada-on-a-dec-pdp-1-from-1959#cmt-12984\">Dalton&#8217;s comment</a> on Playing Boards of Canada on a DEC PDP-1 from 1959:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Somewhere there is a Venn diagram of all the things I like, and this is right in the middle of all of it!</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>It&#8217;s always OK to express your enthusiasm and appreciation for a link or comment.</p>\n\t<p>I also pulled some examples of feedback from social media that I don&#8217;t find helpful in contributing to a good discussion. None of these have a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and_...\">&#8220;yes, and&#8230;&#8221;</a> vibe:</p>\n\t<p>👎 These replies to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cia-world-factbook-ratcliffe-trump-fbec61ce16c4b3db59db9cefce0da043\">the CIA deleting the World Factbook</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>But then, did we ever trust &#8220;facts&#8221; published by the CIA?</p></blockquote>\n\t<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m pretty sure half of them are functionally illiterate anyway so they probably don&#8217;t see the point.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Perfectly fine posts for social media but they wouldn&#8217;t work on KDO; they&#8217;re casually negative and don&#8217;t improve the conversation for others. Discussing the trustworthiness of the CIA, the propaganda aspect of the World Factbook, and the incompetence of the current regime are all worthy topics of discussion, but you&#8217;ve gotta work harder than these drive-by dunks.<sup id=\"fnref:1770947477\"><a href=\"https://kottke.org/#fn:1770947477\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n\t<p>🤦‍♂️ This reply to <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/02/the-strangers-case\">The Strangers&#8217; Case</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Many would say that Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More were unoriginal. This same guidance is found from 1,600 years earlier in Luke 10. Many know is the parable of the Good Samaritan.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Again, very normal social media post. Further context/reading is good, but you can tell us about the Parable of the Good Samaritan without dinging Shakespeare for unoriginality.</p>\n\t<p>😱 This reply to <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/minute-maid-discontinuing-frozen-juice-9.7065520\">the news about canned juice being discontinued</a>:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>OJ is liquid candy anyway, which is why juice sales are stalling. I just wish it weren&#8217;t towards the horrid paint thinner that is kombucha&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Self-explanatory, I hope.</p>\n\t<p>Anyway, I hope you get the gist and that I haven&#8217;t completely scared you off from commenting here. Really, the vast majority of comments here are great and I&#8217;m glad this facet of the site is back.</p>\n\t<ol><li class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn:1770947477\">That said, the tone of <a href=\"https://kottke.org/26/02/0048323-the-cia-has-deleted-the\">my post about the Factbook</a> was not at all positive or constructive: &#8220;The CIA has deleted the CIA World Factbook (a popular almanac about the countries of the world) from the web. Fuck this.

A four-pack of the first-gen Bluetooth trackers is on sale for $64, which is just about a record-low price (only $1 more). That's a 35 percent discount on the pack.</p> \n<p>Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag</a> down to about $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>If you use Apple devices and consider yourself to be a serial thing-misplacer, AirTags are extremely useful. Adding one to your account takes a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network so well established, locating missing items has never been easier.</p> \n<p>Using your iPhone you can trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively Precision Finding can be used to pinpoint its location via Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone, paying attention to the vibrations that signal you’re getting closer.</p> \n<p>A reminder again that the above deals apply to the first-generation AirTag only. Apple introduced a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\">tracker</a> with greater range and a louder speaker last month, which <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0GJTFXNRX&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e745850-e368-4111-83ab-157ddbe84ac4&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=retail&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmU3NDU4NTAtZTM2OC00MTExLTgzYWItMTU3ZGRiZTg0YWM0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaPN9LXQY-0xtODu-zAc_6biP338yFAO58xyoY7PRH7K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-AirTag-2nd-Generation-Precision%2Fdp%2FB0GJTFXNRX%2F\">retail</a>s at the same price as its predecessor.
