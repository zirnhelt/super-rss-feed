This gameplay option will feature some unique cards just for multiplayer as well as some team-wide synergies.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the characters from <em>Slay the Spire</em> will be returning for the sequel alongside new ones. For anyone who hasn't yet experienced the original game, <em>Slay the Spire</em> is <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/slay-the-spire-ios-150017220.html\" target=\"_blank\">available</a> on iOS, including as <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-slay-the-spire-and-ridiculous-fishing-are-coming-to-apple-arcade-in-july-153459825.html\" target=\"_blank\">part of</a> Apple Arcade.

That title <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-axes-two-more-live-service-games-130048000.html\" target=\"_blank\">was cancelled</a> in 2025, alongside another game from Bend Studio. In the context of Sony's other live-service failures, the decision wasn't surprising. Sony shut down the servers for multiplayer shooter <em>Concord</em> just two weeks after its release. Not long after, it also closed <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-pulls-the-plug-on-concord-and-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-180321212.html\" target=\"_blank\">Firewalk Studios</a>, the developer behind the game.</p><p>Bluepoint Games was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-155507719.html\" target=\"_blank\">originally acquired</a> by Sony in 2021, when it seemed like the studio's expertise in remaking and remastering classic PlayStation games could be a major asset going forward. Why that changed isn't entirely clear, but Sony's mismanagement of its pivot into and out of publishing premium online multiplayer games may have played a role. Some of Sony's studios are still experimenting with live-service mechanics. Guerilla Games recently announced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/guerrilla-reveals-horizon-hunters-gathering-a-co-op-action-spin-off-for-ps5-and-pc-162058264.html\" target=\"_blank\">an online co-op game</a> set in its Horizon universe. <em>Destiny 2 </em>developer Bungie is also releasing its extraction shooter <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungies-marathon-arrives-on-march-5-193808588.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Marathon</em></a> in March. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-shutting-down-the-studio-behind-the-demons-souls-remake-195234213.html?src=rss",

They managed to disrupt Finland&#8217;s political order through threats of violence and symbolic kidnappings, in which they would capture political rivals and drive them to the Soviet border.</p>\n\t<p>They earned the support of center-right and moderate politicians who believed they could harness the passion and support of this radical nationalist group. The movement also included prominent businessmen, newspaper owners, and key members of the military.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>But after a few years, the country was able to right the ship:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Almost overnight, the Lapua movement collapsed. Within three years of its founding, this far-right faction was banned from Finnish politics, and democracy in Finland has been stable ever since.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>You can read more about the Lapua movement and how it was defeated in <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/democracys-near-misses/\">this article about democracy&#8217;s &#8220;near misses&#8221;</a>.</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>In November 1929, red-shirted communist youth paraded in the small Finnish village of Lapua, located in the country&#8217;s religious and conservative southern Ostrobothnian region. An angry mob of local farmers attacked the parade, stripped the participants of their shirts, and began beating the unlucky leftists. That seemingly isolated and chance incident sparked a &#8220;a series of events which proved almost fatal to parliamentary government in Finland.</p></blockquote>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Finland\">Finland</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>",

These messages were first uncovered by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs\"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> in 2021 within discovery documents for the Epic Games v.

At the time Apple told Engadget, “child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we are committed to fighting the ways predators put children at risk. We are urgently and actively innovating to combat these crimes without compromising the security and privacy of all our users.&quot;</p>\n<p>The case in West Virginia would mark the first time a governmental body is bringing such an action against the iPhone maker. The state says it is seeking injunctive relief that would compel Apple to implement effective CSAM detection measures as well as damages. We have reached out to Apple for comment on the suit and will update if we hear back.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/west-virginia-is-suing-apple-alleging-negligence-over-csam-materials-164647648.html?src=rss",

It was the final major first-party Switch game ahead of the Switch 2’s arrival in June, and the last doomed Wii U game to be granted a second life on Nintendo’s infinitely more successful console. Nearly a year on, a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html\">Switch 2</a> update for one of the most technically impressive games Nintendo has ever published has finally arrived.</p>\n<p>Somewhat hilariously titled <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition </em>(you get the feeling Nintendo has started a naming convention it may come to regret here), the updated version of Monolith Soft’s sprawling sci-fi RPG now supports up to 60fps performance and 4K resolution when docked to a TV.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"51c7c26b0f22447683787b31105b2673\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The sprawling alien world of planet Mira, now enhanced on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NintendoSwitch2</a> with improved frame rates and up to 4K resolution in TV mode!<br /><br />Join the fight for survival in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/XenobladeChroniclesX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#XenobladeChroniclesX</a>: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, available now! <a href=\"https://t.co/raA1XhIimC\">pic.twitter.com/raA1XhIimC</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2024484113923571725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>As impressive as the Switch remake of the 2015 Wii U game was, given the frankly absurd size of its open-world setting, you could almost feel the hardware creaking under its weight every time you booted the game up, so this patch was much-needed. Unfortunately the graphical and performance enhancements aren’t free for anyone who already owns the Switch version of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>. A $5 upgrade pack is available on the eShop, and the Switch 2 game costs $65 on its own. A physical version is also arriving on April 16.</p>\n<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition </em>(again, won’t someone please think of us writers) was the last of a number of Xenoblade Chronicles games to make its way to Switch. It’s a bit different to the other entries in the series, with its hard sci-fi story, emphasis on side quests and completely seamless open world to explore. Also, stick with the game long enough and you can eventually fly around the entire planet of Mira in a giant mech, which is as fun as it sounds.</p>\n<p>Like the other games in the series, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>is a standalone experience, so don’t worry about jumping in if you’ve never played one before. The series’ signature MMO-like hybrid real-time combat system takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s part of what makes these games stand out from other RPG series.</p>\n<p>The other Xenoblade games in the Switch library, which are <em>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition</em>, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>, are yet to receive Switch 2 updates, but hopefully they'll arrive eventually too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-announces-surprise-switch-2-version-of-sci-fi-rpg-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-153121689.html?src=rss",

But it's still a phone, arguably your most used device on a daily basis, so you may need to top it up during the day if you're using it constantly.

The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

Like the vacuum cleaner with which it shares the first part of its name, the handle measures just 1.5 inches in diameter from top to bottom, and the whole thing weighs little more than 2kg.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The ultra-thin design allows the cleaner to lie almost completely flat, allowing you to get into tight corners or under low furniture, where more traditionally bulky devices might struggle. Its slender proportions also make it easier to store if your home is on the smaller side.</p>\n<p>Dyson says the PencilWash only applies fresh water to floors, and after swiftly eliminating spills and stains it should dry up pretty quickly. Its high-density microfiber roller is designed to tackle both wet and dry debris in one pass, and because it doesn’t have a traditional filter, you won’t have to worry about trapped dirt or lingering smells.</p>\n<p>Above the power buttons there’s a screen displaying remaining battery level, and the handle can be slotted into a charging dock when not in use.</p>\n<p>The Dyson PencilVac will cost $349, with a release date yet to be announced.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/dyson-announces-the-pencilwash-wet-floor-cleaner-230152299.html?src=rss",

With the code <strong>MONARCHVIP</strong>, you’ll pay $50 for one year of access instead of the usual $100.</p>\n<p>We’ve recommended Monarch before for its deep customization options and robust financial planning tools. It supports unlimited account connections, investment tracking and shared budgets, making it a solid option if you want a detailed look at your finances or plan alongside a partner. It also features prominently in our roundup of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html\" target=\"_blank\">best budgeting apps</a>, where it stood out for its depth and flexibility.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Monarch Money is the kind of budgeting app that can feel a little overwhelming at first, especially when you’re setting up categories, rules and recurring transactions. There’s a bit of a learning curve, and some of the finer details are easier to manage on the web than in the mobile app. But once you’re past that initial setup, it starts to make a lot more sense and becomes a powerful tool for keeping tabs on your finances.</p>\n<p>Where Monarch Money really shines is in the level of detail it offers. It’s built for people who want a clear, structured view of their money, not just a running list of transactions. In the budgeting section, you can see budgets versus actual spending by category, along with forecasts by month or by year. Recurring expenses can also be defined using more than just merchant names, which helps keep things accurate with less manual cleanup.</p>\n<p>Beyond day-to-day budgeting, Monarch does a good job of showing the bigger picture. It includes visual reports and charts that make it easier to spot trends over time, plus tools for tracking net worth, investments and financial goals. Monarch can even factor in non-cash assets like your home or vehicle, pulling in estimates automatically so they appear alongside your accounts.</p>\n<p>All of that depth won’t be for everyone, but if you’re willing to spend a little time getting set up, <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cdb5dc60-4d5b-4ea6-ab0e-4cd9b4317487&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNkYjVkYzYwLTRkNWItNGVhNi1hYjBlLTRjZDliNDMxNzQ4NyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUr_Hrzd-ATtIoKDgyQrhn4aUjoS3cxe7UAkFHc9DJ7Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Monarch Money</a> offers a lot of control and insight.
