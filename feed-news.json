It costs $600. The company says this is the \"world's slimmest vacuum cleaner.\" We haven't broken out any rulers to confirm that statement, but it's certainly a ridiculously thin stick vac.</p>\n<p>It achieves this thinness by using a motor inspired by the company's</p>\n<p>. This is a small motor that can actually rest in the shaft, so there's not a noticeable bulge where the components have been placed. This stick vacuum is actually, well, a stick. Just take a look at it.</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"A vacuum being emptied.\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/ce123cb0-fd2e-11f0-96ff-0adad0972d61\" style=\"height: 1154px; width: 1240px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  A vacuum being emptied.\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Dyson\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>It does come with attachments that increase the size a bit. For instance, the conical brush bar cleaner head makes it resemble a traditional stick vacuum. However, everything else is in the long cylinder. This includes the bin, filter and motor.</p>\n<p>Other attachments include something called the \"Fluffycones\" cleaner head. This has four cones in two brush bars that rotate in opposite directions to \"strip and eject even long hair, preventing hair tangling around the brush bar.\" There are also lights at both ends to help illuminate any lingering dust particles.</p>\n<figure>\n <img alt=\"A cleaning head.\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/17d0b750-fd2f-11f0-a7ef-5d9bfb26bd5f\" style=\"height: 1154px; width: 1654px;\" />\n <figcaption>\n  A cleaning head.\n </figcaption>\n <div class=\"photo-credit\">\n  Dyson\n </div>\n</figure>\n<p>It weighs nearly four pounds and features the same diameter throughout. This makes it easy to grip anywhere along the body, which can help with overhead cleaning. It ships with a swappable battery pack that lasts for around an hour and there's a magnetic charging dock to get things juiced up.</p>\n<p>The vacuum works with the MyDyson app, which lets users check on battery life and adjust settings. Some of this information is also displayed on the LCD screen at the top of the handle.</p>\n<p>We got a chance to try it out last year and came away impressed. The motor is plenty powerful, despite the diminished size, and the device was easy to maneuver. If you have $600 to spare and a dirty home, this could be a good purchase.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/the-dyson-pencilvac-is-finally-available-and-costs-600-160059016.html?src=rss",

By you. By me.</p>\n\n<p>Minneapolis is an inspiration to the entire nation. You have heroically stood up against ICE, stood up against Trump, stood up against this terrible rising tide of state terror. You&#8217;ve stood up for your neighbors and for yourselves and for democracy and for justice. Ain&#8217;t nobody coming to save us, except us. And brothers and sisters, you are showing the way.</p>\n\n<p>To that end, we would like to begin our program with an old Native American war chant. We encourage you to singalong, in this very room Prince created a revolution, now it&#8217;s our turn.</p></blockquote>\n\nHere&#8217;s the official video for Killing In The Name:\n\n\n\nPS.

After issues showed up during the mission’s wet dress rehearsal in the early hours of February 3, however, the agency had to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/missions/2026/02/03/nasa-conducts-artemis-ii-fuel-test-eyes-march-for-launch-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\">push back</a> its earliest launch opportunity to March. </p><p>“With more than three years between SLS launches, we fully anticipated encountering challenges. That is precisely why we conduct a wet dress rehearsal. These tests are designed to surface issues before flight and set up launch day with the highest probability of success,” <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/jared-isaacman-is-nasas-new-leader-220833691.html\" target=\"_blank\">NASA administrator</a> Jared Isaacman <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/jared-isaacman-is-nasas-new-leader-220833691.html\" target=\"_blank\">said on X</a>. </p><p>During a wet dress rehearsal, the spacecraft to be used for a mission is loaded with propellants to simulate the actual preparations and countdown to liftoff. NASA explained that Artemis 2’s Space Launch System, which was already on the launch pad, suffered from a liquid hydrogen leak that its engineers spent hours troubleshooting. They were ultimately able to fill all the rocket’s tanks and started the countdown to launch. But with approximately five minutes left in the countdown, the ground launch sequencer automatically stopped due to a spike in the spacecraft’s liquid hydrogen leak rate. </p><p>The agency admits that it has other issues to fix, based on what happened during the rehearsal. It has to make sure that the cold weather doesn’t affect the mission’s equipment during the actual launch in the same way it did in testing . The Orion crew module’s hatch pressurization process took longer than expected, and that should must not happen on launch day. NASA also has to troubleshoot the audio communication channels for its ground teams after they dropped several times during the rehearsal. Artemis’ ground crew will review data from the wet dress rehearsal and address the aforementioned problems. NASA then has to conduct another test to confirm that they were taken care of before announcing the mission’s launch window. </p><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" style=\"width: 608px; height: 893px;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">NASA completed a wet dress rehearsal for the Artemis II mission in the early morning hours on Feb. 3.

Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.</p> \n<p>Hulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like <em>The Bear,</em> <em>The Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>Only Murders in the Building</em>, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.</p> \n<p>The Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.</p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/save-on-the-disney-and-hulu-bundle-get-one-month-for-only-10-192814917.html?src=rss",

That works out to $72 billed upfront for the first 24 months, which represents a 70 percent discount compared to its regular pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">rated Proton VPN highly</a> thanks to its strong privacy credentials, transparent nonprofit backing and consistently fast performance. It’s one of the services we recommend in our guide to the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs</a>, and this deal also shows up alongside other standout offers in our ongoing roundup of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN deals</a>.

We measured average download speeds at 88 percent of our unprotected connection and upload speeds at 98 percent, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming and torrenting. It also unblocked Netflix in every region we tested, and while its Mac and iOS apps aren’t quite as polished as the Windows and Android versions, the service is still easy to install and largely set-it-and-forget-it across platforms. We gave Proton VPN a score of 90 out of 100.</p><p>Proton VPN Plus is the company’s premium tier and includes access to its full server network, which now spans more than 15,000 servers across 120-plus countries. A single subscription covers up to 10 devices at once and unlocks features like NetShield ad and malware blocking, Secure Core “double hop” connections, split tunneling, custom DNS controls and priority customer support. Proton VPN Plus also supports fast P2P traffic on nearly all paid servers and includes VPN Accelerator, which helps maintain high speeds over long-distance connections.</p><p>Right now, Proton VPN Plus is discounted to $2.99 per month when you commit to two years, billed as $72 upfront for the first 24 months. After that, the plan renews annually at $83.88. That’s a 70 percent discount compared to the standard monthly rate. As with Proton’s other paid plans, the subscription comes with a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-proton-vpn-and-get-a-refund-170014128.html\" target=\"_blank\">30-day money-back guarantee</a>, so you can try it risk-free if you’re not ready to lock in long term.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/proton-vpn-two-year-subscriptions-are-70-percent-off-right-now-123000972.html?src=rss",

The raid is being conducted by Paris and national cybercrime units, with support from Interpol, according to post from Paris prosecutors on X. Officials from X have yet to comment on the matter.  </p><p>At the same time, Paris prosecutors issued summonses to Elon Musk and Linda Yaccarino for “voluntary interviews” on April 20, 2026 in Paris. The prosecutors also announced they would no longer use X and would only communicate on LinkedIn and Instagram going forward. </p><p>The searches are part of an investigation that has been ongoing for nearly a year over the functioning of X’s algorithms that are “likely to have distorted the operation of an automated data processing system,” investigators <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2025/02/07/paris-prosecutors-open-investigation-into-x-s-algorithms_6737910_13.html\" target=\"_blank\">said at the time.</a> Those changes reportedly gave greater prominence to certain political content (especially from Musk) without user knowledge — something that could be a crime under French laws. </p><p>An investigation was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/france-launches-criminal-probe-of-xs-alleged-algorithm-manipulation-123017920.html\" target=\"_blank\">officially launched in July</a>, with Paris prosecutors adding an additional charge: “Fraudulent extraction of data from an automated data processing system by an organized group.” More recently, it also includes “complicity in the possession of images of minors representing a pedo-pornographic character,” due to images created by Grok between December 25, 2025 and January 1, 2026. </p><p>In July, X said in a statement that the probe “egregiously undermines X’s fundamental right to due process and threatens our users' rights to privacy and free speech. [French officials have] accused X of manipulating its algorithm for 'foreign interference' purposes, an allegation which is completely false.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xs-paris-hq-raided-by-french-prosecutors-110411170.html?src=rss",

The best iPhone cases add useful features like MagSafe compatibility, grippy finishes and protection for camera lenses, all without adding unnecessary bulk to your new iPhone.<br /><br />Whether you prefer slim, scratch resistant designs, matte finishes or leather cases that feel a bit more premium, there are plenty of strong top picks to choose from. We’ve rounded up the best picks for both the iPhone 17 and 17 Pro, so you don’t have to waste time scrolling through endless listings.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-iphone-17-cases-for-2026\">Best iPhone 17 cases for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-iphone-17-case-faqs\">Best iPhone 17 case FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-most-protective-brand-of-phone-cases\">What is the most protective brand of phone cases?</h3> \n<p>There is no one &quot;most protective&quot; brand of phone cases, but rather there are many that tout extra security for your handset. Some of the most protective phone cases we've tried come from <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://fave.co/46pHh8g\">Otterbox</a>; most of the brand's cases have a bit more protection than your standard phone case, even the ones that are designed to be on the slim side. Otterbox also makes a wide variety of phone cases, so there's a good chance you'll find one that suits your style and provides the level of protection you're looking for. <a class=\"no-affiliate-link\" href=\"https://fave.co/4gyZMM7\">Otterbox's Defender series</a> is one of the best you can get if you care first and foremost about making sure your phone survives all kinds of accidents (save for a dunk in a pool).</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-silicone-vs-hard-case-which-one-is-better\">Silicone vs hard case: Which one is better?</h3> \n<p>Neither silicone nor hard cases are better than the other. Silicone cases tend to be thinner and feel soft to the touch, and they're often easier to put on and take off of phones. Hard cases can be on the thicker side, but they provide a bit more drop protection than silicone cases. Which type of case is best for you depends on the type of experience you want from your phone. It's also worth nothing that both silicone cases and hard cases come in a variety of colors, designs and styles, so you have plenty of choose from to match your personality on both sides.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-an-iphone-17-need-a-screen-protector\">Does an iPhone 17 need a screen protector?</h3> \n<p>The iPhone 17 features Apple’s tough Ceramic Shield 2 front, which is definitely more durable than standard glass — but it’s not invincible. If you want to avoid scratches from keys, drops onto pavement or just the wear and tear of daily use, a screen protector is still a smart move. It adds an extra layer of defense without getting in the way of touch sensitivity or Face ID. So, while it’s not absolutely essential, using one is a good idea if you want to keep your screen looking flawless for the long haul.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-the-iphone-17-drop-proof\">Is the iPhone 17 drop-proof?</h3> \n<p>The iPhone 17 is built to be tough, with Ceramic Shield 2 on the front and a sturdy aluminum or titanium frame (depending on the model), but it’s not completely drop-proof. It can handle the occasional bump or short fall, especially if it lands on a flat surface — but drops on concrete or at awkward angles can still cause cracks or damage. If you’re prone to butterfingers, pairing your iPhone 17 with a durable case and maybe even a screen protector is the best way to play it safe.</p> \n<p><em>Georgie Peru contributed to this report.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-iphone-cases-153035988.html?src=rss",

The flaw was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.wiz.io/blog/exposed-moltbook-database-reveals-millions-of-api-keys\" target=\"_blank\">discovered</a> by cybersecurity firm Wiz, and its team assisted Moltbook with addressing the vulnerability. </p><p>The issue appears to be the result of the entire Reddit-style forum being vibe-coded; Moltbook's human founder <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/mattprd/status/2017386365756072376\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> a few days ago on X that he &quot;didn't write one line of code&quot; for the platform and instead directed an AI assistant to create the whole setup.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the blog post from Wiz analyzing the issue, Moltbook had a vulnerability that allowed for &quot;1.5 million API authentication tokens, 35,000 email addresses and private messages between agents&quot; to be fully read and accessed. Wiz also found that the vulnerability could let unauthenticated human users edit live Moltbook posts. In other words, there is no way to verify whether a Moltbook post was authored by an AI agent or a human user posing as one. &quot;The revolutionary AI social network was largely humans operating fleets of bots,&quot; the company's analysis concluded.&nbsp;</p><p>So ends another cautionary tale reminding us that just because AI can do a task doesn’t mean it'll do it correctly.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/moltbook-the-ai-social-network-exposed-human-credentials-due-to-vibe-coded-security-flaw-230324567.html?src=rss",

The merger will “form the most ambitious, vertically-integrated innovation engine on (and off) Earth, with AI, rockets, space-based internet, direct-to-mobile device communications and the world’s foremost real-time information and free speech platform,” Musk wrote in an update.</p><p>The AI company that right now is best known for its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html\" target=\"_blank\">CSAM-generating chatbot</a> might seem like a strange fit for a rocket company. But SpaceX is key to Musk’s latest scheme to build AI data centers in space. In his update, Musk wrote that “global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions” and that moving the resource-intensive operations to space is “the only logical solution.” SpaceX just days ago filed an application with the FCC to create an “<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-wants-to-launch-a-constellation-of-a-million-satellites-to-power-ai-needs-175607771.html\" target=\"_blank\">orbital data center</a>” by launching a million new satellites.</p><p>Musk also claimed that, eventually, space-based data centers will enable other advancements in space travel. “The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe.” Notably, it’s not the first time Musk has made lofty claims about Mars. He predicted <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-29-space-x-mars-bfr-elon-musk.html\" target=\"_blank\">in 2017</a> that SpaceX would send crewed missions to Mars by 2024. </p><p>This also isn’t the first time Musk has acquired one of his own companies. He <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xai-elon-musks-ai-company-just-purchased-x-elon-musks-social-media-company-221503759.html\" target=\"_blank\">merged xAI and X</a> last year, which means SpaceX now owns the social network Musk bought in 2022. And he recently announced that Tesla was investing <a class=\"no-affiliate-link link\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/tesla-to-invest-2-billion-in-xai-elon-musks-openai-competitor.html\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion</a> into xAI. SpaceX is planning to go public later this year in an initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at more than $1 trillion, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-02/elon-musk-s-spacex-said-to-combine-with-xai-ahead-of-mega-ipo\" target=\"_blank\">according to</a> <em>Bloomberg, </em>which notes that SpaceX has also “discussed a possible merger with Tesla.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-spacex-has-acquired-his-ai-company-xai-221617040.html?src=rss",

David Michaud-Cromp, a level design team lead at Ubisoft Montreal, said last week that he was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-punishes-developer-union-strike-return-to-office-2000663771\" target=\"_blank\">suspended</a> for three days without pay after voicing opposition to the company's return to office mandate.

Shortly after many employees at Ubisoft Halifax unionized, the parent company <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-a-studio-16-days-after-it-unionized-183000983.html\" target=\"_blank\">shut down</a> the studio. In announcing the closure, Ubisoft said the move was part of a broader cost-cutting endeavor across its operations; it shut down a support studio and cut more jobs <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-shuts-down-a-support-studio-and-lays-off-185-workers-191048262.html\" target=\"_blank\">later in January</a>, with even more layoffs <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-proposes-even-more-layoffs-after-last-weeks-studio-closures-and-game-cancellations-192703241.html\" target=\"_blank\">proposed</a>. Most recently, unions representing other Ubisoft workers called for <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-173241918.html\" target=\"_blank\">a three-day strike</a> in response to the &quot;penny-pinching and worsening our working conditions&quot; they alleged of the company's management.</p><p>All these issues could all be coincidental timing. But if so, they're coincidences that don't reflect favorably on Ubisoft.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/ubisoft-fires-employee-who-publicly-criticized-its-rto-plan-220913747.html?src=rss",
