In announcing the new 40 Years of Nugget limited edition, it released exactly one exterior photo against a stock backdrop and one interior photo. Unacceptable. We made sure to stop by and grab more pictures of the world's latest Nugget camper van, and then found ourselves drawn in by the drastic color contrast between the different models.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/ford-nugget-40-year-camper-van/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/campervans/\">Campervans</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/adventure-vehicles/\">Adventure Vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/outdoors/\">Outdoors</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/campervan/\" rel=\"tag\">Campervan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/mini-campervan/\" rel=\"tag\">mini-campervan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/\" rel=\"tag\">RV</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/cmt-2026/\" rel=\"tag\">cmt-2026</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/ford/\" rel=\"tag\">Ford</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/\" rel=\"tag\">Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/\" rel=\"tag\">Outdoors and Camping</a></p>",

The quarter ending December 27, 2025 marked &quot;the best-ever quarter&quot; for iPhones, which generated a record high revenue of nearly $85.27 billion for the business. Apple doesn't disclose the number of devices sold any more, but even with the prices for many of its latest generation of smartphones surpassing $1,000 a pop, that's still got to be a heck of a lot of iPhones.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The demand for iPhone was simply staggering,&quot; CEO Tim Cook said on the conference call to discuss the results. &quot;This is the strongest iPhone lineup we've ever had and by far the most popular.&quot;</p><p>That wasn't the only massive number in the earnings report. Services revenue also logged its biggest quarter yet, growing 14 percent over the same period last year to reach just over $30 billion. It was also Apple's biggest quarter to date for total revenue, which was nearly $143.76 billion for the already fabulously wealthy company.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-reported-its-best-ever-quarter-for-iphone-sales-234135513.html?src=rss",

      "title": "Amazon discovered a 'high volume' of CSAM in its AI training data but isn't saying where it came from",
      "content_html": "<p></p><p>The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said it received more than 1 million reports of AI-related child sexual abuse material (CSAM) in 2025. The &quot;vast majority&quot; of that content was reported by Amazon, which found the material in its training data, according to an investigation by <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-29/amazon-found-child-sex-abuse-in-ai-training-data\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. In addition, Amazon said only that it obtained the inappropriate content from external sources used to train its AI services and claimed it could not provide any further details about where the CSAM came from.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;This is really an outlier,&quot; Fallon McNulty, executive director of NCMEC’s CyberTipline, told <em>Bloomberg</em>. The CyberTipline is where many types of US-based companies are legally required to report suspected CSAM. “Having such a high volume come in throughout the year begs a lot of questions about where the data is coming from, and what safeguards have been put in place.” She added that aside from Amazon, the AI-related reports the organization received from other companies last year included actionable data that it could pass along to law enforcement for next steps. Since Amazon isn’t disclosing sources, McNulty said its reports have proved “inactionable.”</p><p>&quot;We take a deliberately cautious approach to scanning foundation model training data, including data from the public web, to identify and remove known [child sexual abuse material] and protect our customers,&quot; an Amazon representative said in a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>. The spokesperson also said that Amazon aimed to over-report its figures to NCMEC in order to avoid missing any cases. The company said that it removed the suspected CSAM content before feeding training data into its AI models.&nbsp;</p><p>Safety questions for minors have emerged as a critical concern for the artificial intelligence industry in recent months. CSAM has skyrocketed in NCMEC's records; compared with the more than 1 million AI-related reports the organization received last year, the 2024 total was 67,000 reports while 2023 only saw 4,700 reports.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to issues such as abusive content being used to train models, AI chatbots have also been implicated in several dangerous or tragic cases involving young users. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-first-known-ai-wrongful-death-lawsuit-accuses-openai-of-enabling-a-teens-suicide-212058548.html\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/another-lawsuit-blames-an-ai-company-of-complicity-in-a-teenagers-suicide-184529475.html\" target=\"_blank\">Character.AI</a> have both been sued after teenagers planned their suicides with those companies' platforms. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-temporarily-pulling-teens-access-from-its-ai-chatbot-characters-180626052.html\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a> is also being sued for alleged failures to protect teen users from sexually explicit conversations with chatbots.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/amazon-discovered-a-high-volume-of-csam-in-its-ai-training-data-but-isnt-saying-where-it-came-from-224749228.html?src=rss",

Shares of xAI would reportedly be exchanged for shares in SpaceX under the merger. <em>Reuters</em> reports that two entities were set up in Nevada on January 21 to facilitate the deal. </p><p>If the idea of two Musk companies becoming one sounds familiar, that's because it happened less than a year ago. In March 2025, xAI bought X, putting Grok (known for <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html\" target=\"_blank\">nonconsensual &quot;nudifying&quot; images</a>) and X (infamous for being <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-gave-x-users-its-opinion-on-white-genocide-in-south-africa-whether-they-liked-it-or-not-151803191.html\" target=\"_blank\">a far-right hellscape</a>) together <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/xai-elon-musks-ai-company-just-purchased-x-elon-musks-social-media-company-221503759.html\" target=\"_blank\">under one unholy roof</a>.</p><p>The latest idea Musk is pitching is blasting AI data centers off into space. At last week's gathering of the rich and powerful in Davos, Switzerland, he said, &quot;The lowest cost place to put AI will be in space. And that will be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.&quot; The idea is that data centers in orbit could harness solar power and reduce cooling costs. However, industry analysts and executives consider it a risky bet, questioning whether the savings would warrant the massive investment. If or when the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/leading-financial-institutions-are-worried-about-a-looming-ai-bubble-130827642.html\" target=\"_blank\">AI bubble bursts</a>, the plan could go down in flames — if not literally, then figuratively.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/elon-musks-spacex-and-xai-are-reportedly-holding-merger-talks-211740150.html?src=rss",

If that figure is accurate, the Q.ai acquisition marks Apple's second largest acquisition to date, followed by its purchase of Beats for <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-28-apple-to-acquire-beats-electronics-and-beats-music-for-3-billio.html\" target=\"_blank\">$3 billion</a> back in 2014.</p><p>Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of hardware technologies, said in a statement that Q.ai &quot;is a remarkable company that is pioneering new and creative ways to use imaging and machine learning.&quot; Apple hasn't shared any specifics about how it plans to leverage the startup, but its past work indicates the possibility of Apple moving deeper into AI-powered wearables. &quot;Patents filed by Q.ai show its technology being used in headphones or glasses, using 'facial skin micro movements' to communicate without talking,&quot; the <em>Times</em> reported.&nbsp;</p><p>The startup's founding team, including CEO Aviad Maizels, will join Apple as part of the deal. This acquisition marks Maizels' second sale to Apple; he previously founded a three-dimensional hearing business called PrimeSense that Apple bought back in 2013.</p><p>For several months, many tech insiders have speculated that an acquisition might be Apple's best path forward to catching up in the AI race.

The music publishers say they found that Anthropic had been illegally downloading thousands of songs during the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3b-over-flagrant-piracy-of-20000-works/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\"><ins>discovery process of that suit</ins></a>.</p>\n<div id=\"4616e9701c2d48308e64680cddd03411\"></div>\n<p>For the unfamiliar, the Bartz v. Anthropic case ended with an award of $1.5 billion to impacted writers after it was found that the company had illegally downloaded their published works for similar training purposes. The terms of that agreement dictated that the 500,000 authors involved in the case would get $3,000 per work. The $1.5 billion looks like a big number, but not so much when broken down like that. Also, Anthropic <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/anthropic-plans-raise-10-billion-350-billion-valuation-wsj-reports-2026-01-07\"><ins>is worth around $350 billion</ins></a>.</p>\n<p>In the Bartz case, Judge William Alsup ruled that it was legal for Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted content but not legal to acquire that content via piracy. We'll have to wait and see how this new suit shakes out. The legal precedent here seems to suggest that if Anthropic would have just spent a buck on each copyrighted song, then they'd be in the clear. That's an odd distinction when it comes to building an entire company around snatching up copyrighted content, but whatever.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3-billion-over-flagrant-piracy-185459358.html?src=rss",

      "content_html": "<p>This past summer, Google DeepMind <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-deepminds-genie-3-can-dynamically-alter-the-state-of-its-simulated-worlds-140052124.html\" target=\"_blank\">debuted Genie 3</a>. It’s what’s known as a world world, an AI system capable of generating images and reacting as the user moves through the environment the software is simulating. At the time, DeepMind positioned Genie 3 as a tool for training AI agents. Now, it’s making the model available to people outside of Google to try with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-deepmind/project-genie/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Genie</a>. </p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>To start, you’ll need Google’s $250 per month AI Ultra plan to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-wants-250-per-month-in-return-for-its-new-ai-ultra-plan-180248513.html\" target=\"_blank\">check out Project Genie</a>. You’ll also need to live in the US and be 18 years or older. At launch, Project Genie offers three different modes of interaction: World Sketching, exploration and remixing. The first sees Google’s <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Banana Pro</a> model generating the source image Genie 3 will use to create the world you will later explore. At this stage, you can describe your character, define the camera perspective — be it first-person, third-person or isometric — and how you want to explore the world Genie 3 is about to generate. Before you can jump into the model’s creation, Nano Banana Pro will “sketch” what you’re about to see so you can make tweaks. It’s also possible to write your own prompts for worlds others have used Genie to generate. </p><p>One thing to keep in mind is that Genie 3 is not a game engine. While its outputs can look game-like, and it can simulate physical interactions, there aren’t traditional game mechanics here. Generations are also limited to 60 seconds, as is the presentation, which is capped at 24 frames per second and 720p. Still, if you’re an AI Ultra subscriber, this is a cool opportunity to see the bleeding edge of what DeepMind has been working over the past couple of years.         </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-project-genie-lets-you-generate-your-own-interactive-worlds-183646186.html?src=rss",

      "content_html": "<p>Maingear is back with another nostalgia-fueled gaming PC. The Retro98 may look like it's made for playing <em>Quake</em> while you wait for <em>The Phantom Menace</em> trailer to drop. But on the inside, the beige box is powerful enough to slay today's most demanding AAA games. &quot;You're not going to find this PC at your local Radio Shack,&quot; Maingear promises.</p><p>If you're at least middle-aged, the Retro98's exterior is instantly familiar. The hand-built tower includes an LED fan-speed display, a working turbo button and a power-lockout key. Sticking with the nostalgic motif, its front I/O is hidden behind the Maingear logo. I can already hear The Beastie Boys' “Intergalactic” playing in the background.</p><p>Fortunately, you won't be limited to 1998 games. (Dope as they are.) It has up to a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-review-a-no-compromise-cpu-for-demanding-gamers-152452811.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ryzen 9 9950X3D</a> processor, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review-pure-ai-excess-for-2000-140053371.html\" target=\"_blank\">GeForce RTX 5090</a> graphics, 64GB Kingston Fury RAM and 4TB Kingston FURY Renegade NVMe Gen5 SSD.

As you might expect from a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/maingears-retro95-pc-blends-90s-workstation-nostalgia-with-modern-horsepower-123027821.html\" target=\"_blank\">retro novelty PC</a> like this, you'll have to pay a pretty penny. The base model (Intel Core Ultra 7 265K / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070) costs $2,499. There are two other standard tiers, priced at $3,499 and $4,999. Finally, the open-loop-cooled &quot;Alpha&quot; build is a whopping $9,799. Hey, those aren't 1998 prices!</p><p>The Retro98 also has an extremely limited run. Maingear is producing only 32 standard units and six alpha units. The company says it won't bring this build back once those sell out. However, there is a workaround for tinkerers: Since it's based on the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/flp02/\" target=\"_blank\">SilverStone FLP02</a> tower PC case, you could grab one of those and build your own.</p><p>Those wealthy and nostalgic enough to take the plunge can order the Retro98 today from <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://maingear.com/collections/retro98\" target=\"_blank\">Maingear’s website</a>. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/maingears-latest-retro-gaming-desktop-takes-you-back-to-the-quake-era-174958445.html?src=rss",
