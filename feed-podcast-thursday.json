Replies from the recipient will also be delivered via satellite, as long as the connection remains active.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-you-need-before-you-can-send-satellite-messages\"><strong>What you need before you can send satellite messages</strong></h2><p>Sending messages via satellite requires a compatible iPhone model and the correct software version. The feature is supported on iPhone models with satellite hardware, beginning with iPhone 14 and later. The device must be running a version of iOS (<a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=0cf8bae0-8869-4c98-830a-b2eebb48d4bf&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;linkText=iOS+18+or+higher&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzLzEyMDkzMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMGNmOGJhZTAtODg2OS00Yzk4LTgzMGEtYjJlZWJiNDhkNGJmIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N1cHBvcnQuYXBwbGUuY29tL2VuLXVzLzEyMDkzMCJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAVawW2OetIgztQH6ZCmrWu9f6HIHY9uITW7D05T6sali&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.apple.com%2Fen-us%2F120930\" target=\"_blank\">iOS 18 or higher</a>) that supports satellite messaging, which Apple has continued to refine through recent iOS updates.</p><p>The feature also depends on location and availability. Satellite messaging is currently supported in select regions, including the United States and parts of Canada, with expanded support rolling out gradually. The iPhone must be outdoors with a clear view of the sky, as trees, buildings and terrain can interfere with the satellite connection.</p><p>Satellite messaging is not designed for continuous conversations. Messages are compressed and sent at a slower pace than standard texts, and delivery times can vary depending on conditions and satellite positioning.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-how-satellite-messaging-works-on-iphone\"><strong>How satellite messaging works on iPhone</strong></h2><p>When an iPhone loses access to cellular and Wi-Fi networks, the system automatically detects that only satellite connectivity is available. Instead of failing to send, the Messages app prompts the user to connect to a satellite.</p><p>On-screen instructions guide the user to position the phone correctly. This typically involves holding the device up and following directional prompts to align it with an overhead satellite. The phone uses built-in sensors to help maintain the connection while the message is being sent.</p><p>Messages sent via satellite are text-only and use a reduced data format to ensure they can be transmitted reliably. Images, videos, audio messages and large attachments are not supported.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-who-can-receive-satellite-messages\"><strong>Who can receive satellite messages?</strong></h2><p>Satellite messages can be sent to contacts using iMessage or standard SMS, depending on the recipient’s device and settings. If the recipient is using an Apple device with iMessage enabled, the message will be delivered through Apple’s messaging system. If not, the message will be sent as a standard text.</p><p>Recipients do not need a satellite-capable device to receive messages. From their perspective, the message appears similar to a regular text, though delivery times may be longer.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-tips-for-getting-a-reliable-connection\"><strong>Tips for getting a reliable connection</strong></h2><p>A clear view of the sky is essential for satellite messaging to work properly. Open areas with minimal obstructions offer the best results. Movement, heavy foliage and nearby structures can interrupt the connection.</p><p>Because satellite bandwidth is limited, keeping messages short improves reliability and delivery speed. The iPhone may prompt the user to edit longer messages to fit within satellite constraints.</p><p>Battery life is also a consideration. Maintaining a satellite connection uses more power than standard messaging, so it helps to conserve battery when relying on satellite features for extended periods.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-limitations-to-keep-in-mind\"><strong>Limitations to keep in mind</strong></h2><p>Satellite messaging is designed for occasional use when other networks are unavailable. It does not support group messages, media attachments or read receipts in the same way as standard messaging.</p><p>Delivery times can range from under a minute to several minutes, depending on environmental conditions and satellite availability. The feature should not be relied upon for time-sensitive communication unless no other option is available.</p><p>Apple has also noted that satellite features may be offered free for a limited period, with potential pricing or subscription requirements introduced in the future depending on region and carrier arrangements.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-satellite-messaging-can-be-useful\"><strong>When satellite messaging can be useful</strong></h2><p>Messaging via satellite can be helpful for travelers, hikers and anyone spending time in remote areas where coverage is unreliable. It offers a way to check in, share basic updates or request non-emergency assistance when traditional networks are unavailable.</p><p>While it is not a replacement for emergency services, it complements Apple’s existing emergency satellite features by providing an additional communication option when users are off the grid.</p><p>As Apple continues to expand satellite support, messaging via satellite is likely to become a more familiar part of the iPhone experience, particularly for users who regularly venture beyond the reach of cellular networks.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-send-a-message-via-satellite-on-iphone-130000418.html?src=rss",
