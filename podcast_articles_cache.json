    "description": "<p>Anyone who's been paying even a little bit of attention to tech news lately could have made a reasonable guess that AI will be a big topic at <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-the-s26-launch-on-february-25-130000524.html\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung's Unpacked</a> next week. Ahead of the event, Samsung teased some of what's to come for AI in terms of the Galaxy S26 smartphone lineup's photography tools.&nbsp;</p><p>The S26 phones will feature a new camera system using Galaxy AI that combines capturing, editing and sharing of photos and videos. &quot;Users will be able to turn a photo from day to night in seconds, restore missing parts of objects in images, capture detailed photos in low light, and seamlessly merge multiple photos into a single, cohesive result,&quot; a company rep said. The video clips Samsung shared demonstrated the before and after results of using its AI tools, which will all be housed in a single app rather than needing to switch between multiple image editing programs.</p><p>Updated cameras are just part of what will be on the schedule for Samsung's big mobile showcase. The expected Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ and Galaxy S26 Ultra will likely have a lot of AI-centric features.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-teases-mobile-ai-photography-tools-ahead-of-unpacked-233000358.html?src=rss",

This is the hot new trend in air travel: pulling out all the stops to cater to the wealthy.</p>\n\t<p>Airlines are adding suites with more bed space, privacy doors, an extra ottoman for guests. They&#8217;re offering caviar, free PJs, luxury skin care products, and multi-course meals with wine pairings made by gourmet chefs. They&#8217;re also building more airport lounges. Meanwhile, economy is getting more cramped and low-cost carriers are going bankrupt. It&#8217;s because wealthy passengers are where the money&#8217;s at.</p>\n\t<p>For years, airlines have made more money from their credit cards than from actually flying passengers around. And these days, premium seating is bringing in more revenue than the economy cabin. It&#8217;s a perfect example of the K-shaped economy.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kshaped-economy-spending-income-inequality-dfa59144ecb2e1b674242666e28ff556\">an AP article about the K-shaped economy</a> from late last year.</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers.</p></blockquote>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/business\">business</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/economics\">economics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>",

The lawsuit also says that firmware vulnerabilities in TP-Link's hardware have already &quot;exposed millions of consumers to severe cybersecurity risks.&quot;</p><p>TP-Link provided the following statement to Engadget in response to the lawsuit: </p><blockquote><p>The claims made by the Texas Attorney General’s office are without merit and will be proven false. TP-Link Systems Inc. is an independent American company. Neither the Chinese government nor the CCP exercises any form of ownership or control over TP-Link, its products, or its user data. TP-Link’s founder and CEO, Jeffrey Chao, resides in Irvine, CA, and is not and never has been a member of the CCP. To ensure the highest level of security, our core operations and infrastructure are located entirely within the United States, and all U.S. users' networking data is stored securely on Amazon Web Services servers. We will continue to vigorously defend our reputation as a trusted provider of secure connectivity for American families.</p></blockquote><p>TP-Link was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/tp-link-routers-are-being-investigated-by-several-us-authorities-151552304.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly being investigated</a> at the federal level in 2024 after its devices were connected to the massive <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/new-report-details-vast-spying-by-china-linked-telecom-hackers-010347224.html\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Salt Typhoon&quot; hack</a> that accessed data from multiple US telecom companies.

The company has <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/2023847540400288134\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> that Google I/O 2026 will take place on May 19 and 20<strong>. </strong>As always, Google will stream some of the keynotes and sessions for free, including the opening keynote (during which the company makes the bulk of its major I/O announcements).</p><p>Although I/O is primarily a conference for developers, it’s typically where we first learn about major upcoming Android changes, which of course affect tens of millions of people.

This year’s puzzle has multiple “builds” to play through, all of which use Gemini. </p><p>They start with a mini-golf game in which a virtual caddy that’s powered by Gemini offers some of the most anodyne advice imaginable. The second build is a nonogram. If you’ve ever played a Picross game, you’ll know what to do here. It’s about using logic to place tiles on a grid in order to create an image. Here, Google is using Gemini to generate “endless game boards.”</p><p>The other three minigames are Word Wheel (which “leverages Gemini 3 to automate level design”), Super Sonicbot (which “uses Gemini to introduce microphone mechanics where noise controls the Android Bot’s altitude”) and Stretchy Cat. The latter “uses Gemini 3 as a stage designer balancing game mechanics and difficulty to create endless play.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/google-io-2026-is-set-for-may-19-and-20-200805024.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>Netflix has been in the game adaptation business for a while now, but until recently most of its attention had been on adapting <em>video </em>games. That’s still very much <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-show-could-kick-off-in-ancient-rome-200238552.html\">happening</a>, but the streaming giant is also now buying up rights for board game IP too, with the latest being Asmodee’s <em>Ticket to Ride</em>.</p>\n<p>Netflix will look to greenlight a number of projects spanning TV, film and &quot;additional formats,&quot; it wrote in a press release. The first of these will be a feature film written by Ben Mekler and Chris Amick. <em>Ticket to Ride </em>creator Alan R. Moon will serve as an executive producer on the project, which will be the game’s first on-screen adaptation. Exactly what it will look like is not yet clear, but the internet already has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1r78sau/netflix_developing_ticket_to_ride_movie/\"><ins>plenty</ins></a> of theories.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Ticket to Ride</em> is a train-themed turn-based strategy and route-building game first released over 20 years ago. Since then it has gone on to ship more than 20 million copies and has been translated into over 30 languages. It’s also been given the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-12-ticket-to-ride-tabletop-ps4-playlink-mobile.html\"><ins>video game</ins></a> adaptation treatment before.</p>\n<p>This is actually the second of Asmodee’s IP that Netflix has acquired the rights to, after announcing last year that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-adapting-catan-into-movies-and-tv-shows-185133712.html\"><em><ins>Catan</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>will also be making its way to screens in various forms. And it isn’t just interested in scripted TV and movie opportunities. In early 2025, the company also signed a deal with Hasbro to adapt <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/04/monopoly-reality-competition-series-netflix-1236362416/\"><em><ins>Monopoly</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>into a TV game show.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-is-adapting-the-board-game-ticket-to-ride-180505164.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>ExpressVPN is <a href=\"https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order\">back on sale</a> again, and its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now. You can get the Advanced tier for $88 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.14 for the promo period.</p> \n<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html\">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> \n<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/save-up-to-81-percent-on-expressvpn-two-year-plans-right-now-180602273.html?src=rss",

WordPress says the assistant understands your website's look and brand and can tailor the media accordingly.</p><p>WordPress also added the AI assistant to the platform's team chat, Block Notes. You can summon the chatbot from within your team chat threads.</p><p>The tool is available for WordPress.com's Business or Commerce plans. (Or, if you made your site using the AI builder, it's enabled by default, no matter which plan you use.) The feature works best with the platform's block themes; it's much more limited with classic ones. You'll find the toggle to activate the AI assistant in your site settings under the &quot;AI tools&quot; section.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/wordpress-adds-an-ai-assistant-174719676.html?src=rss",

Meta-owned Instagram and Facebook currently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-announces-paid-subscriptions-for-both-instagram-and-facebook-in-the-uk-140913304.html\">offer a similar feature</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchat-gives-parents-more-info-on-who-their-kids-are-talking-to-120000077.html\">Snapchat</a>, creator subscriptions will give users access to exclusive content across Snaps and Stories. They will also get priority replies and go ad-free on stories. Snapchat pitches the new feature as great way to give creators &quot;freedom to experiment&quot; and &quot;build a recurring income stream&quot; — all good things for keeping people on your platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Creators can choose exactly how much they want to charge subscribers per month.

That’s where Apple’s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFH9BST&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b81fb587-99ff-4a0a-8491-b9b9460d3e9a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=iPhone+Air+MagSafe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjgxZmI1ODctOTlmZi00YTBhLTg0OTEtYjliOTQ2MGQzZTlhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1QiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR9o3Bk1eGEoY_MpvpdVaX8WwrXHv-kJY6NrXwaRfhTy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFH9BST\">iPhone Air MagSafe</a> battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

While it's easy enough to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html\">replace the battery</a> in both versions of the AirTag, you may not want to have to rush to do so at the end of the battery's roughly two-year lifespan.

It's not the first time <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-extended-battery-airtag-case-is-down-to-only-16-162308748.html\">we've seen this deal</a>, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This is arguably one of the more useful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag accessories</a> around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> \n<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> \n<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-airtag-10-year-extended-battery-case-is-only-16-right-now-151215061.html?src=rss",

Adding one to your account takes a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network so well established, locating missing items has never been easier.</p> \n<p>Using your iPhone you can trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively Precision Finding can be used to pinpoint its location via Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone, paying attention to the vibrations that signal you’re getting closer.</p> \n<p>A reminder again that the above deals apply to the first-generation AirTag only. Apple introduced a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\">tracker</a> with greater range and a louder speaker last month, which <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0GJTFXNRX&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e745850-e368-4111-83ab-157ddbe84ac4&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=retail&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmU3NDU4NTAtZTM2OC00MTExLTgzYWItMTU3ZGRiZTg0YWM0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaPN9LXQY-0xtODu-zAc_6biP338yFAO58xyoY7PRH7K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-AirTag-2nd-Generation-Precision%2Fdp%2FB0GJTFXNRX%2F\">retail</a>s at the same price as its predecessor.

    "description": "<p>The European Commission (EC) has <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_26_420\"><ins>opened an investigation</ins></a> into low-cost fast fashion retailer Shein. EC officials are concerned about the sale of illegal products, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddrg70pj1mo\"><ins>child sexual abuse material</ins></a>, as well as the potentially addictive design of its shopping experience. The Commission found fellow low-cost retailer Temu <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1913\"><ins>in violation</ins></a> of the Digital Services Act after a similar investigation last year.</p>\n<p>The probe is being opened under the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act\"><ins>Digital Services Act</ins></a>, a set of EU rules governing online services. The Commission will examine how Shein drives engagement with shoppers, including using a points and rewards system, and whether the company is properly mitigating the risk of addiction via these and other features.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Algorithmic recommendation systems are another point of contention, and the Commission will ask Shein to disclose how it suggests  products to users. It also says that the company must offer users a system that is not based on profiling.</p>\n<p>The Singapore-based company has faced a great deal of scrutiny in past years on a number of fronts, including its labor practices, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyg7n1d85go\"><ins>materials sourcing</ins></a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-temu-and-more-face-complaints-alleging-gdpr-violations-in-eu-195115567.html\"><ins>data practices</ins></a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/what-is-stake-china-founded-e-commerce-giant-shein-eu-rule-looms-2024-06-19/\"><ins>IP infringement</ins></a>.

    "title": "EU launches second investigation into Grok's nonconsensual image generation",
    "description": "<p>X is facing yet another investigation into Grok's reported creation of nonconsensual sexual images on the platform. Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has announced an <a href=\"https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-opens-investigation-x-xiuc\">inquiry into X</a> regarding the harmful, intimate images and processing of EU and EEA individuals' personal data — including children.</p>\n<p>In an 11-day period, X generated about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html\">three million sexualized images</a>, an estimated 23,000 of which were of children. British nonprofit, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) announced the <a href=\"https://counterhate.com/research/grok-floods-x-with-sexualized-images/\">results</a> of its December 29 to January 9 review last month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Critically, the investigation will determine whether X has broken GDPR laws. &quot;The DPC has been engaging with XIUC since media reports first emerged a number of weeks ago concerning the alleged ability of X users to prompt the @Grok account on X to generate sexualised images of real people, including children,&quot; DPC deputy commissioner Graham Doyle said, referring to X using the full title X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Doyle continued: &quot;As the Lead Supervisory Authority for XIUC across the EU/EEA, the DPC has commenced a large-scale inquiry which will examine XIUC’s compliance with some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand.&quot;</p>\n<p>The DPC's probe could have repercussions for X across the EU, while also building on similar probes in the bloc. In January, the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-eu-is-investigating-grok-and-x-over-potentially-illegal-deepfakes-134506678.html\">launched an investigation</a> into whether X has violated the Digital Services Act. It's looking into if X has properly &quot;assessed and mitigated&quot; Grok's risks on X, including the spread of illegal content such as the AI-generation nonconsensual sexually explicit images. Once again this includes those of children — this disturbing point can't be emphasized too much.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>X claimed in mid-January that it was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-says-grok-will-no-longer-edit-images-of-real-people-into-bikinis-231430257.html\">preventing Grok</a> from editing photos of real people to give them revealing clothing. However, this seems far from the truth. Earlier this month, a male reporter found Grok would still put him <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-which-maybe-stopped-undressing-women-without-their-consent-still-undresses-men-170750752.html\">in revealing clothing</a> and even added visible genitalia.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-launches-second-investigation-into-groks-nonconsensual-image-generation-113239967.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best noise-canceling headphones for 2026",
    "description": "<p>Noise is hard to escape, whether it’s the hum of traffic, the buzz of a busy office or the neighbor’s lawn mower starting up right when you need to focus. That’s where noise-canceling headphones earn their keep. A good pair doesn’t just quiet the world around you, it creates a pocket of calm so you can actually enjoy your music, podcasts or peace and quiet.<br /><br />Modern noise-canceling headphones have come a long way, combining powerful ANC with clearer sound, longer battery life and smarter features like adaptive modes and multipoint connectivity. Some emphasize comfort for long flights, while others are tuned for audiophiles who want studio-level clarity.<br /><br />We’ve tested a wide range of options to find the best noise-canceling headphones for every listener. Whether you’re after something lightweight for travel or a premium set for focused work sessions, these picks deliver the sound, silence and comfort you need to tune out the chaos.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-noise-canceling-headphones-of-2026\">Best noise-canceling headphones of 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-\"></h2> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-noise-canceling-headphones-for-you\">How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>For gamers, there are also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html\">gaming headsets</a> that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.</p> \n<p>Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.</p> \n<p>Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-headphones\">How we test noise-canceling headphones</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.</p> \n<p>ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-noise-canceling-headphones-we-tested\">Other noise-canceling headphones we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-airpods-max\">AirPods Max</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326-143034684.html\">Apple’s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-dyson-on-trac\">Dyson On-Trac</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/dyson-ontrac-headphones-review-when-the-basics-arent-enough-151518312.html\">On-Trac headphones</a> have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sonos-ace\">Sonos Ace</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html\">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sony-ult-wear\">Sony ULT Wear</h3> \n<p>If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-ult-wear-headphones-review-brain-shaking-bass-160000739.html\">ULT Wear</a> is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-beats-studio-pro\">Beats Studio Pro</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html\">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-master--dynamic-mh40-2nd-gen\">Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html\">MH40</a> are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bowers--wilkins-px8\">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8</h3> \n<p>The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html\">Px8</a> is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-noble-audio-fokus-apollo\">Noble Audio FoKus Apollo</h3> \n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html\">this</a> is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">best wireless headphones</a>, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers &amp; Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-noise-canceling-headphones-faqs\">Noise-canceling headphones FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-block-all-noise\">Does noise cancellation block all noise?</h3> \n<p>Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-there-a-difference-between-wired-vs-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones\">Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?</h3> \n<p>In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-impact-sound-quality\">Does noise cancellation impact sound quality?</h3> \n<p>ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

This allows the mics to pair with iPhones and iPads via Bluetooth without the need for a receiver. All you’ll need is the Rode Capture app. </p><p>Rode said it’s able to offer Direct Connect for Wireless Pro and Wireless Go without compromising “the broadcast-quality audio both wireless systems are known for.” The feature still supports the option to record from two transmitters in either merged (whereby the audio blends into a single stereo track) or split (which keeps the recordings on separate channels to allow for more options in post-production) modes.</p><p>Not having to worry about setting up a physical receiver to link these mics to iOS devices could help streamline things quite a bit for creators. And I can always get behind companies adding handy features to existing products without pushing customers to buy new models. That’s good for the environment, your wallet — assuming you already have one of these mics — and probably the company’s reputation. An all-around positive update. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/more-rode-mics-can-now-connect-directly-to-iphones-and-ipads-230000533.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best noise-canceling earbuds for 2026",
    "description": "<p>Noise-canceling earbuds have become an everyday essential for a lot of people, whether you’re trying to survive a noisy commute, concentrate in a shared workspace or just carve out a little quiet time. Advances in active noise cancellation and audio processing mean today’s best earbuds do a much better job of cutting through background noise, without forcing you to move up to bulky over-ear headphones.<br /><br />The latest models also balance sound quality with convenience, offering stable Bluetooth connections, comfortable fits and battery life that can last through a full day with help from their charging cases. From premium options with the strongest ANC to more affordable picks that still get the basics right, there’s no shortage of solid choices depending on what you value most.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-noise-cancelling-earbuds-for-2026\">Best noise-cancelling earbuds for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-noise-canceling-earbuds-for-you\">How to choose the best noise-canceling earbuds for you</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>Most true wireless earbuds these days have a “traditional” design that’s a round bud that fits in your ear canals. However, there are some variations on the formula in terms of shape, size and additional fitting elements. Some companies include fins or fit wings to help hold their in-ear earbuds in place while others opt for an over-the-ear hook on more <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html\">sporty models</a>. You’ll want to pay attention to these things to make sure they align with how you plan to use them. Also consider overall size and weight since those two factors can impact the fit. A less-than-ideal seal due to a weird fit will affect the performance of active noise-canceling earbuds.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of earbuds offer. You’ll see terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>the outside of the device to detect ambient noise. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it’s at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups or ear tips. Adaptive ANC is also better at combating wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using earbuds outdoors. For this top pick list of the best noise-canceling earbuds, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise in noisy environments.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of earbuds offers presets or adjustable levels of noise reduction. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that either provide maximum noise-blocking or prioritize energy efficiency. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-earbuds\">How we test noise-canceling earbuds</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for ANC earbuds is typically 6-10 hours, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). When necessary, I’ll power the headphones off during a review without putting them back in the case. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to wear them for an entire day.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use the earbuds in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I also use them during air travel, since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I’m not slated to hop on a flight, I simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well earbuds block human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC setups.</p> \n<p>I also do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double-checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set, and revisit the closest competition as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-earbuds-150026857.html?src=rss",

    "title": "iPhone Fold rumors: Everything we know so far, including the leaked design, upgrades, price and more details",
    "description": "<p>Apple still hasn’t officially announced a foldable iPhone, but the rumor mill hasn’t slowed down. Over the past few months, analysts, supply-chain watchers and leakers have continued to sketch out what Apple’s first folding phone might look like and when it could finally arrive. Most signs still point to a late-2026 debut, though plenty could change between now and then.</p><p>As always with unreleased Apple hardware, nothing here is confirmed. Plans can shift, features can be reworked and timelines can slip. Still, the volume and consistency of recent reporting gives us a better sense than ever of how the so-called iPhone Fold could take shape.</p><p>Below, we’ve rounded up the most credible rumors so far, and we’ll keep this guide updated as new details emerge.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-could-the-iphone-fold-launch\">When could the iPhone Fold launch?</h2><p>Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://theorg.com/org/bloomberg/org-chart/mark-gurman\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Gurman</a> has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-11/apple-2027-plans-tabletop-robot-20th-anniversary-iphone-ios-19-wi-fi-feature\" target=\"_blank\">ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027</a>. Analyst <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\" target=\"_blank\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.</p><p>Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-iphone-fold-look-like\">What will the iPhone Fold look like?</h2><p>Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-already-thinking-about-its-second-foldable-iphone-and-it-may-be-a-clamshell-202312700.html\" target=\"_blank\">clamshell flip phone</a>.</p><p>When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3030017/a-case-maker-might-have-leaked-the-iphone-fold-design.html\" target=\"_blank\">CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds</a> suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-hands-on-the-super-sleek-precursor-to-apples-upcoming-foldable-185851102.html\" target=\"_blank\"> iPhone Air as a potential preview</a> of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.</p><p>If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.</p><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a476c2e0-9780-11f0-bd4b-d87caa240702\" style=\"height: 1263px; width: 2400px;\" /><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><h2 id=\"jump-link-display-and-the-crease-question\">Display and the crease question</h2><p>The display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.</p><p>Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-crease-less-foldable-oled-panel-showcased-z-fold-8/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel</a>, which several sources — including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a> — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.</p><p>According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.</p><p>If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-cameras-and-biometrics\">Cameras and biometrics</h2><p>Camera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:</p><ul><li><p>Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)</p></li><li><p>One punch-hole camera on the outer display</p></li><li><p>One under-display camera on the inner screen</p></li></ul><p>Several sources claim <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple will avoid Face ID</a> entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-will-reportedly-bring-back-touch-id-on-a-foldable-iphone-135831748.html\" target=\"_blank\">rely on Touch ID</a> built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.</p><p>Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://wccftech.com/apples-first-foldable-iphone-to-have-a-24-megapixel-under-display-selfie-camera-no-faceid/\" target=\"_blank\">rumored 24MP sensor</a> would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-iphone-folds-hinge-and-materials\">iPhone Fold’s hinge and materials</h2><p>The hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/14/iphone-folds-titanium-liquid-metal-rumors-just-wont-go-away\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple reports claim Apple will use </a>Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.</p><p>Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/youtuber-jon-prosser-posts-foldable-iphone-renders\" target=\"_blank\">Leaks from Jon Prosser</a> also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-battery-and-other-components\">Battery and other components&nbsp;</h2><p>Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=224077504572&amp;navType=by\" target=\"_blank\">multiple Asian supply-chain reports</a>, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.</p><p>That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-price\">Price</h2><p>None of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone</a> ever.</p><p>Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,”</a> while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.</p><p>Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-design-upgrades-price-and-more-details-130000074.html?src=rss",

AI-assisted live translations are being introduced for Holy Mass attendees — the holy masses if you will. The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican has teamed up with <a href=\"https://translated.com/english-translation-services?\">Translated</a>, a language service provider, to create live <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-ai-voice-translation-feature-rolls-out-globally-200945034.html\">translations</a> in 60 languages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;Saint Peter’s Basilica has, for centuries, welcomed the faithful from every nation and tongue. In making available a tool that helps many to understand the words of the liturgy, we wish to serve the mission that defines the centre of the Catholic Church, universal by its very vocation,&quot; Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, O.F.M. Conv., Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican, said in a statement. &quot;I am very happy with the collaboration with Translated. In this centenary year, we look to the future with prudence and discernment, confident that human ingenuity, when guided by faith, may become an instrument of communion.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Visitors to the Vatican will have the option to scan a QR code. They will then have access to live audio and text translations of the liturgy. It doesn't require an app and should work right on a web page.</p>\n<p>The technology stems from Lara, a translation AI tool Translated launched in 2024. Translated claims that Lara works with the &quot;sensitivity of over 500,000 native-speaking professional translators.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-vatican-introduces-an-ai-assisted-live-translation-service-163014907.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<div id=\"c92556da27e14f64b1a498698eec58e0\"></div>\n<p>Bloober Team has revealed <em>Layer of Fear 3</em> following a Valentine's Day countdown that started at the beginning of 2026. The new chapter will include not only a game but a novel and music, the company said in a <a href=\"https://blooberteam.prowly.com/446859-layers-of-fear-3-revealed-bloober-team-is-expanding-its-horror-multiverse-with-new-games-and-cross-media-content\">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The developer revealed the new IP via a live-action teaser, with an actor reading lines from William Blake's poem, <em>The Sick Rose</em>. A painting then fell from the wall, and the actor then turned over an hourglass with red sand, with a tagline stating &quot;The door won't stay closed.&quot; No gameplay or other information like the release date was revealed.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>What Bloober did say, though, is that it would launch new <em>Layer of Fear</em> non-game content, including a novel by horror writer, poet and vocalist Marta Bijan. The company also announced that it would release the soundtracks for <em>Layer of Fear,</em> <em>The Medium</em> and <em>Cronos</em> both in digital and physical (CD and vinyl) editions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new title is likely to be eagerly anticipated given Bloober's form of late. The company recently released its <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cronos-the-new-dawn-seems-to-smush-dead-space-and-control-together-in-a-good-way-172611962.html\"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></a> and a new Switch 2 <em>Layers of Fear 2</em> version called <em>Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</em>. The original <em>Layers of Fear</em> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-25-layers-of-fear-valentines-day-love-horror.html\">came out back in 2016</a> and is considered one of the better horror titles of recent years, thanks to an expertly crafted narrative and psychedelic thrills and chills. The sequel moved to a creepy ocean liner and was equally well-received.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Feb. 16, 2026 at 3:06PM ET</strong>: The headline was updated with the correct game name.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/layers-of-3-revealed-via-a-mysterious-trailer-and-poem-153021903.html?src=rss",
