    "title": "Xbox head Phil Spencer is leaving Microsoft",
    "description": "<p>Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, is retiring, Satya Nadella <a class=\"no-affiliate-link link\" href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2026/02/20/asha-sharma-named-evp-and-ceo-microsoft-gaming/\" target=\"_blank\">has announced</a>. Asha Sharma, the President of Microsoft's CoreAI division is taking over Spencer's role, while Sarah Bond, the current President of Xbox, is resigning.</p><p>&quot;I am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me,&quot; Nadella says. &quot;Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.&quot;</p><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 365px;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">I’m excited for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asha_shar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@asha_shar</a> as she steps into the CEO role. She’s joining an incredible group of people; teams full of talent, heart, and a deep commitment to the players they serve. Watching her lean in with curiosity and a real desire to strengthen the foundation we've built…</p>— Phil Spencer (@XboxP3) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/2024951219782054359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 20, 2026</a></blockquote>\n\n\n</div><p>In a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://x.com/XboxP3/status/2024951219782054359?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">thread on X</a>, Spencer shared his thoughts on Sharma’s new position. “I’m excited for [Asha Sharma] as she steps into the CEO role,” Spencer wrote. “She’s joining an incredible group of people; teams full of talent, heart, and a deep commitment to the players they serve. Watching her lean in with curiosity and a real desire to strengthen the foundation we've built gives me confidence that our Xbox communities will be well supported in the years ahead.”</p><p>Alongside Sharma, Matt Booty, the current head of Xbox Game Studios, is getting promoted to Chief Content Officer, and will report to Sharma. Sarah Bond, who like Spencer served as a public face for the Xbox brand and was assumed to be his successor, is leaving Microsoft to &quot;begin a new chapter.&quot; Bond has yet to make a public statement about her resignation.</p><p>Spencer joined Microsoft in 1988, and has worked on Xbox since at least 2001. He assumed responsibility for Microsoft's gaming brand and its various studios and associated subscription products in 2013, before becoming an Executive VP of Gaming in 2017 and later CEO of Microsoft Gaming in 2022. Spencer's biggest impact on Xbox will likely be remembered as the creation of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-24-xbox-game-pass-launch-date-100-games-june-1st.html\" target=\"_blank\">Game Pass</a>, Microsoft's &quot;Netflix for Games&quot; and the wave of studio acquisitions Microsoft completed from 2018 to 2022, which included smaller studios like <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-09-double-fine-joins-microsoft-studios.html\" target=\"_blank\">Double Fine</a> and the massive<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-now-officially-belongs-to-microsoft-125053787.html\" target=\"_blank\"> $68.7 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard King</a>.</p><p>While Microsoft has plenty of developers and IP to fall back on, it's struggled to compete with the likes of Sony and Nintendo during the current console generation. Microsoft's gaming division has gone through <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-gaming-division-suffers-further-layoffs-142430386.html\" target=\"_blank\">widespread layoffs</a>, its revenue <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-console-revenue-fell-30-percent-year-over-year-this-summer-012245146.html\" target=\"_blank\">continued to fall</a> throughout 2025 and it raised the prices of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-making-xbox-consoles-even-more-expensive-in-the-us-192443699.html\" target=\"_blank\">both its consoles</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-jacks-the-price-of-game-pass-ultimate-up-to-30-a-month-142441307.html\" target=\"_blank\">Game Pass Ultimate</a>, which likely won't help things going forward. Sharma is in many ways inheriting <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/2025-was-the-year-xbox-died-130000467.html\" target=\"_blank\">a broken-down car</a>.</p><p>As far as her plans go, Sharma’s email to staff that was included in Nadella's announcement is light on details. Sharma says she plans to continue developing &quot;great games,&quot; wants to &quot;recommit&quot; to core Xbox fans and &quot;invent new business models and new ways to play.&quot; Whether that’s enough to turn Xbox's fortunes around remains to be seen.<br /><br /><strong>Update, February 20, 4:52PM ET:</strong> Added statement from Phil Spencer shared on X.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-head-phil-spencer-is-leaving-microsoft-212838419.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Tunic publisher claims TikTok ran 'racist, sexist' AI ads for one of its games without its knowledge",
    "description": "<p>Indie publisher and developer Finji has accused TikTok of using generative AI to alter the ads for its games on the platform without its knowledge or permission. Finji, which published indie darlings like <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-16-night-in-the-woods-nintendo-switch-february-1st.html\"><em><ins>Night in the Woods</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-11-tunic-first-look-xbox-zelda-e3-2018.html\"><em><ins>Tunic</ins></em></a><em>, </em>said it only became aware of the seemingly modified ads after being alerted to them by followers of its official TikTok account.</p>\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/tunic-night-in-the-woods-publisher-says-tiktok-is-creating-and-running-racist-genai-ads-for-its-games-without-permission\"><em><ins>IGN</ins></em></a>, Finji alleges that one ad that went out on the platform was modified so it displayed a &quot;racist, sexualized&quot; representation of a character from one of its games. While it does advertise on TikTok, it told <em>IGN </em>that it has AI &quot;turned all the way off,&quot; but after CEO and co-founder Rebekah Saltsman received screenshots of the ads in question from fans, she approached TikTok to investigate.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>A number of Finji ads have appeared on TikTok, some that include montages of the company’s games, and others that are game-specific like <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@finjico/video/7569673433924095246\"><ins>this</ins></a> one for <em>Usual June</em>. According to <em>IGN</em>, the offending AI-modified ads (which are still posted as if they’re coming directly from Finji) appeared as slideshows. Some images don’t appear to be that different from the source, but one possibly AI-generated example seen by IGN depicts <em>Usual June</em>’s titular protagonist with &quot;a bikini bottom, impossibly large hips and thighs, and boots that rise up over her knees.&quot; Needless to say (and obvious from the official screenshot used as the lead image for this article), this is not how the character appears in the game.</p>\n<p>As for TikTok’s response, IGN printed a number of the platform’s replies to Finji’s complaints, in which it initially said, in part, that it could find no evidence that &quot;AI-generated assets or slideshow formats are being used.&quot; This was despite Finji sending the customer support page a screenshot of the clearly edited image mentioned above. In a subsequent exchange, TikTok appeared to acknowledge the evidence and assured the publisher it was &quot;no longer disputing whether this occurred.&quot; It added that it has escalated the issue internally and was investigating it thoroughly.</p>\n<p>TikTok does have a &quot;Smart Creative&quot; option on its ad platform, which essentially uses generative AI to modify user-created ads so that multiple versions are pushed out, with the ones its audience responds more positively to used more often. Another option is the <a href=\"https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/about-automate-creative?lang=en\"><ins>“Automate Creative”</ins></a> features, which use AI to automatically optimize things like music, audio effects and general visual &quot;quality&quot; to &quot;enhance the user’s viewing experience.&quot; Saltsman showed <em>IGN </em>evidence that Finji has both of these options turned off, which was also confirmed by a TikTok agent for the ad in question.</p>\n<p>After a number of increasingly frustrated exchanges in which TikTok eventually admitted to Saltsman that the ad &quot;raises significant issues, including the unauthorized use of AI, the sexualization and misrepresentation of your characters, and the resulting commercial and reputational harm to your studio,&quot; the Finji co-founder was offered something of an explanation.</p>\n<p>TikTok said that Finji’s campaign used a &quot;catalog ads format&quot; designed to &quot;demonstrate the performance benefits of combining carousel and video assets in Sales campaigns.&quot; It said that this &quot;initiative&quot; helped advertisers &quot;achieve better results with less effort,&quot; but did not address the harmful content directly. Finji seemingly also opted into this ad format without knowing it had done so. TikTok declined to comment on the matter when approached by <em>IGN</em>.</p>\n<p>Saltsman was told the issue could not be escalated any higher, with communication not resolved at the time of <em>IGN </em>publishing its report. In a statement to the outlet, Saltsman said she was &quot;a bit shocked by TikTok’s complete lack of appropriate response to the mess<em>&nbsp;</em>they made.&quot; She went on to say that she expected both an apology and clear reassurance of how a similar issue would not reoccur, but was &quot;obviously not holding my breath for any of the above.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/tunic-publisher-claims-tiktok-ran-racist-sexist-ai-ads-for-one-of-its-games-without-its-knowledge-185303395.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Pluralistic: A perforated corporate veil (20 Feb 2026)",
    "description": "Today's links A perforated corporate veil: The Brazilian method for curbing corporate power. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Social media turned US parties into host organisms for third parties; \"Citizens\" are hired actors; Insured exoskeletons; Talking with Snowden and Gibson. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. A perforated corporate veil (permalink) \"Capitalist realism\" is the idea that the world's current economic and political arrangements are inevitable, and that any attempt to alter them is a) irrational; b) doomed; and c) dangerous. It's the ideology of Margaret Thatcher's maxim, \"There is no alternative.\" Obviously this is very convenient if you are a current beneficiary of the status quo. \"There is no alternative\" is a thought-stopping demand dressed up as an observation. It means, \"Don't try and think of alternatives.\" The thing is, alternatives already exist and work very well. The Mondragon co-ops in Spain constitute a fully worked out, long-term stable economic alternative to traditional capitalist enterprises, employing more than 100,000 people and generating tangible, empirically measured benefits to workers, customers and the region: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation Proponents of capitalist realism will tell you that Mondragon doesn't count. Maybe it's just a one-off. Or maybe it's just not big enough. 100,000 workers sounds like a lot, but Amazon has over 1.5m employees and untold numbers of misclassified contractors who are employees in everything but name (and legal rights). This is some pretty transparent goalpost moving, but sure, let's stipulate that Mondragon doesn't prove that there are broadly applicable alternatives to the dominant capitalism of the mid-2020s. Are there other examples of \"an alternative?\" There sure are. Let's look at limited liability. Limited liability &#8211; the idea that a company's shareholders cannot be held liable for the company's misdeeds &#8211; is a bedrock of capitalist dogma. The story goes that until the advent of the \"joint stock enterprise\" (and its handmaiden, limited liability) there was no efficient way to do \"capital formation\" (raising money for a project or business). Because of this, the only ambitious, capital-intensive projects were those that caught the fancy of a king, a Pope, or an aristocrat. But once limited liability appears on the scene, many people of modest means can jointly invest in a project without worrying about being bankrupted if it turns out that the people running it are crooks or bumblers. That lets you, say, buy a single share of a company without having to keep daily tabs on the management's every action without worrying that if they go wrong, someone they've hurt will sue you for everything you've got. Capital formation is a real thing, and limited liability unquestionably facilitates capital formation. There are plenty of good things in the world that exist because limited liability protections allowed everyday people to help bring them into existence. This isn't just stuff that makes a lot of money for capitalism's true believers, it includes everything from the company that makes the printing presses that your favorite anarchist zine runs on to the mill that makes the alloys for the e-bike you use to get to a demonstration. This is where capitalist realism comes in. Capitalist realists will claim that there is no way to do capital formation for these beneficial goods without limited liability &#8211; and not just any limited liability, but maximum limited liability in which the \"corporate veil\" can never be pierced to assign culpability to any shareholder. The capitalist realist claim is that the corporate veil is like the skin of a balloon, and that any attempt to poke even the smallest hole in it will cause it to rupture and vanish. But this just isn't true, and we can tell, because one of the largest economies in the world has operated with a perforated corporate veil for nearly a century, and that economy hasn't suffered from capital formation problems. Quite the contrary, some of the world's largest (and most destructive) monopolies are headquartered in this country where the veil of limited liability is thoroughly perforated. The country I'm talking about is Brazil, which has had limited limited liability since 1937: https://lpeproject.org/blog/when-workers-pierce-the-corporate-veil-brazils-forgotten-innovation/ As Mariana Pargendler writes for the LPE Project, Brazil put limits on limited liability to address a common pattern of corporate abuse. Companies would set up in Brazil, incur a lot of liabilities (say, by poisoning the land, water and air, or by stealing from or maiming workers), and then, when the wheels of justice caught up with them, the companies would fold and re-establish themselves the next day under a new name. Like I say, this happens all over the world. It's incredibly common, and even the pettiest of crooks know how to use this trick. I know someone whose NYC apartment was flooded by the upstairs neighbor, who decided that they didn't need to worry about the fact that their toilet wouldn't stop running &#8211; for months, until the walls of the apartment downstairs dissolved in a slurry of black mold. The upstairs neighbor owned the apartment through an LLC, which they simply folded up and walked away from, while my friend was stuck with a giant bill and no one to sue. The limited liability company is the scammer's best friend. In the UK, an anti-tax extremist invented a tax-evasion scam whereby landlords pretend that their empty commercial buildings are tax-exempt \"snail farms\" by scattering around some boxes with a few snails in them: https://www.patreon.com/posts/149255928?collection=1941093 When this results in inevitable stonking fines and adverse judgments, the \"snail farmers\" duck liability by folding up their limited liability company after transferring its assets to a new LLC. Capitalist realists will tell you that this is just the price of efficient capital formation. Without total, airtight limited liability &#8211; the sort that allows for this kind of obvious, petty ripoff &#8211; no one would be able to raise capital for anything. Brazil begs to differ. In 1937, Brazil made parent companies liable for their subsidiaries' obligations, with a system of \"joint and several liability\" for LLCs. This was expanded with 1943's Consolidation of Labor Laws, and it worked so well that the Brazilian legislature expanded it again in 2017. Remember back in 2024, when Elon Musk defied a Brazilian court order about Twitter, only to have Brazil freeze Starlink's assets until Musk caved? That was the \"joint and several\" liability system: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/world/americas/brazil-musk-x-starlink.html As Pargendler writes, Brazil's liability system \"represented a distributive choice: prioritizing Brazilian workers’ ability to enforce their rights over foreign capital’s interest in minimizing costs through corporate structuring.\" Pargendler (who teaches at Harvard Law) co-authored a paper with São Paulo Law's Olívia Pasqualeto analyzing the impact that Brazil's limited liability system had on capital formation and corporate conduct: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6105586 Unsurprisingly, they find that there has been a steady pressure to erode the joint and several system, but also that some countries (the US and France) have a \"joint employer\" doctrine that is a weak form of this. Portugal, meanwhile, adopted the Brazilian system, 70 years after Brazil &#8211; this transposition of law from a former colony to a former colonial power is apparently called \"reverse convergence\": https://lpeproject.org/blog/heterodox-corporate-laws-in-the-global-south/ More countries in the global south have adopted regimes similar to Brazil's, like Venezuela and Chile. Other countries go further, like Mozambique and Angola. Somewhere in between are other Latin American countries like Peru and Uruguay, where these rules have entered practice through judicial rulings, not legislation. The authors don't claim that perforating the corporate veil solves all the problems of exploitative, fraudulent or corrupt corporate conduct. Rather, they're challenging the capitalist realist doctrine that insists that this system couldn't possibly exist, and if it did, it would be a disaster. A hundred years of Brazilian law, and Brazil's globe-spanning corporate giants, beg to differ. (Image: Gage Skidmore, CC BY-SA 2.0, modified) Hey look at this (permalink) Rep.

    "title": "US website 'freedom.gov' will allow Europeans to view hate speech and other blocked content",
    "description": "<p>The US State Department is building a web portal, where Europeans and anyone else can see online content banned by their governments, according to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-plans-online-portal-bypass-content-bans-europe-elsewhere-2026-02-18/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Reuters</em></a>. It was supposed to be launched at Munich Security Conference last month, but some state department officials reportedly voiced their concerns about the project. The portal will be hosted on <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://freedom.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">freedom.gov</a>, which currently just shows the image above. “Freedom is Coming,” the homepage reads. “Information is power. Reclaim your human right to free expression. Get Ready.”</p><p><em>Reuters</em> says officials discussed making a virtual private network function available on the portal and making visitors’ traffic appear as if they were from the US, so they could see anything unavailable to them. While it’s a state department project, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/feb/19/us-builds-website-that-will-allow-europeans-to-view-blocked-content\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Guardian</em></a> has traced the domain to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which is a component of the US Department of Homeland Security. Homeland also serves as the administrator for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). </p><p>The project could drive the wedge further between the US and its European allies. European authorities don’t usually order broad censorships preventing their citizens from being able to access large parts of the internet. Typically, they only order the blocking of hate speech, terrorist propaganda, disinformation and anything illegal under the EU’s Digital Services Act or the UK’s Online Safety Act. </p><p>“If the Trump administration is alleging that they’re gonna be bypassing content bans, what they’re gonna be helping users access in Europe is essentially hate speech, pornography, and child sexual abuse material,” Nina Jankowicz, who served as the executive director of Homeland Security’s Disinformation Governance Board, told <em>The Guardian</em>. The board was very short-lived and was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-national-security-83c67505703c02b0de154b21abd5c569\" target=\"_blank\">disbanded</a> a few months after it was formed, following complaints by Republican lawmakers that it would impinge on people’s rights to free speech. </p><p>When asked about the project, the state department said it didn’t have a program specifically meant to circumvent censorship in Europe. But the spokesperson said: “Digital freedom is a priority for the State Department, however, and that includes the proliferation of privacy and censorship-circumvention technologies like VPNs.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/us-website-freedomgov-will-allow-europeans-to-view-hate-speech-and-other-blocked-content-130000014.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>Los Angeles County has <a href=\"https://lacounty.gov/2026/02/19/la-county-sues-roblox-for-unfair-and-deceptive-business-practices-that-endanger-and-exploit-children/\">sued</a> Roblox for &quot;unfair and deceptive business practices,&quot; claiming the platform's moderation and age-verification systems are inadequate. &quot;Roblox portrays its platform as a safe and appropriate place for children to play,&quot; the complaint states. &quot;In reality, and as Roblox well knows, the design of its platform makes children easy prey for pedophiles.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Representatives accused Roblox of failing to implement adequate platform safety features to prevent child endangerment. &quot;Specifically, Roblox has not effectively moderated game content or enforced age-appropriate restrictions and warnings established by the creators, allowing the predatory and inappropriate language and interactions between users to persist,&quot; the County stated. It also said the platform failed to disclose any danger to children, including sexual content and the risk of predators.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Roblox rejected the allegations, saying the platform was built around safety. &quot;We have advanced safeguards that monitor our platform for harmful content and communications, and users cannot send or receive images via chat, avoiding one of the most prevalent opportunities for misuse seen elsewhere online,&quot; the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/feb/20/los-angeles-sues-roblox-la-county\">told the <em>AFP</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The LA county complaint is the latest in a string of lawsuits from US regions including Florida, Texas and Kentucky. The Attorney General in Louisiana also <a href=\"https://lailluminator.com/briefs/louisiana-files-lawsuit-against-roblox-calling-it-a-platform-for-sexual-predators/\">accused</a> the company of having a &quot;lack of safety protocols&quot; that endanger the safety of children in favor of &quot;growth, revenue and profits.&quot; That state's lawsuit cited a specific example of a subject arrested last year that used voice-altering tech to mimic a younger feminine voice to lure and sexually exploit young players.</p>\n<p>Roblox has said that it has about 144 million daily active users around the world, with over 40 percent of them under the age of 13. However, it has faced repeated <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/\">accusations</a> that it doesn't do enough to protect young players. In 2024, Roblox banned players under 13 from accessing some types of in-game content and restricted their ability to message with other players outside of specific games. Last year, the company also began asking tens of millions of children to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/roblox-begins-asking-tens-of-millions-of-children-to-verify-their-age-with-a-selfie-120000311.html\">verify their age</a> with a selfie.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/la-county-lawsuit-accuses-roblox-of-exposing-children-to-grooming-and-exploitation-124523028.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Google Play used AI to help block 1.75 million bad apps in 2025",
    "description": "<p>Google has <a href=\"https://security.googleblog.com/2026/02/keeping-google-play-android-app-ecosystem-safe-2025.html\">announced</a> that with the help of AI, it blocked 1.75 million apps that violated its policies in 2025, significantly down from 2.36 million in 2024. The lower numbers this year, it said, are because its &quot;AI-powered, multi-layer protections&quot; are deterring bad actors from even trying to publish bad apps.</p>\n<p>Google said it now runs more than 10,000 safety checks on every app and continues to recheck them after they're published. Its use of the latest generative AI models helps human reviewers discover malicious patterns more quickly, it added. The company also blocked 160 million spam ratings, preventing an average 0.5-star rating drop for apps targeted by review bombing. Finally, Google stopped 255,000 apps from gaining excessive access to sensitive user data in 2025, down from 1.3 million the year before.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meanwhile, Google Play Protect, the company's Android defense system, sniffed out over 27 million new malicious apps, either warning users or preventing them from running. The company added that Play Protect's enhanced fraud protection now covers 2.8 billion Android devices in 185 markets and blocked 266 million risky &quot;side-loading&quot; installation attempts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;Initiatives like developer verification, mandatory pre-review checks, and testing requirements have raised the bar for the Google Play ecosystem, significantly reducing the paths for bad actors to enter,&quot; the company said its blog. &quot;This year, we’ll continue to invest in AI-driven defenses to stay ahead of emerging threats and equip Android developers with the tools they need to build apps safely.&quot;</p>\n<p>Google has steadfastly justified its relatively high fees on app purchases and subscriptions by touting its investments in app safety. However, its Play store has been under pressure from regulators in Europe and other regions that claim it amounts to a monopoly. Last year, the company changed its fee structure for developers using alternative payment channels, but EU regulators recently claimed the company <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-eus-new-charges-against-google-could-lead-to-at-least-35-billion-in-fines-165850585.html\">still isn't complying</a> with Digital Markets Act regulations.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/google-play-used-ai-to-help-block-175-million-bad-apps-in-2025-102208054.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best cheap Android phones to buy in 2026",
    "description": "<p>Getting a solid Android phone doesn’t necessitate spending a small fortune. The best budget models strike a great balance between price and performance, giving you smooth everyday use without cutting too many corners. Whether you’re scrolling social media, streaming your favorite shows or snapping photos of a night out, there’s an affordable Android phone that can handle it all.<br /><br />Cheaper phones have come a long way in recent years. Many now feature bright, fast displays, reliable cameras and battery life that lasts well into the next day. You might miss out on top-tier extras like the latest processor or ultra-high-resolution zoom, but what you get instead is value that makes sense. Some models even surprise with cameras that rival far pricier flagships, making them ideal for casual photographers or anyone who just wants to capture a great shot on the go.<br /><br />We’ve tested budget Android phones from brands like Google, Samsung and OnePlus to find the ones that deliver the most for less. These are the models that prove you don’t need a flagship price tag to get a dependable Android phone.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-budget-android-phones-for-2026\">Best budget Android phones for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-cheap-should-you-go-for-an-android-phone\">How cheap should you go for an Android phone?</h2> \n<p>We tend to define a budget smartphone as costing between $150 and $350. Any lower and the device runs the risk of suffering from too many compromises in function, and above that, you cross over to pricier <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-engadget-guide-to-the-best-midrange-smartphones-120050366.html\">midrange handsets</a> (if you're open to spending more, we shouted out a couple of our favorite flagship phones at the very end of this guide).</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>But for those with a little wiggle room, there are some things to consider. For example, a child may be better off with a cheaper device, especially if it’s intended mainly for emergencies, WiFi browsing or texting parents (and not social media). On the higher end of this price spectrum, sub-$350 Samsung phones and other Android devices have come a long way thanks to improved performance, better phone cameras with low-light capabilities, fast charging, and nicer displays like AMOLED panels. This makes them a viable alternative to, say, a flagship handset with a premium design, even if you have the flexibility to spend more.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-cheap-android-phone\">What to look for in a cheap Android phone</h2> \n<p>When it comes to cheap phones, you get what you pay for. Most smartphones in this price range are made out of plastic, though the fit and finish of a specific model can vary a lot based on price. A bright screen is also important. Typically you’ll get LCD panels with a 60Hz or 90Hz refresh rate, but some phones may have OLED or AMOLED screens with increased color saturation. Long battery life is critical as well, so we tend to favor devices with larger power cells of around 5,000 mAh. In this price range, performance can vary a lot, so look for devices with at least 8GB of RAM and processors that can deliver stutter-free visuals. It’s also important to consider support length: as periodic security updates and lengthy software support can extend the longevity of your device, which will save you money in the long run.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-android-phone-faqs\">Android phone FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-whats-the-price-difference-for-a-cheap-android-vs-a-cheap-iphone\">What's the price difference for a cheap Android vs a cheap iPhone?</h3> \n<p>iPhones tend to be more expensive compared to Android phones — even the cheapest iPhone, the iPhone SE, which starts from $429, is a harder pill to swallow compared to a cheap Android phone. In contrast, you can get your hands on a cheap Android device for as low as $100.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-cheap-android-phone-160029703.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>Meta is formally sectioning off Horizon Worlds, the closest thing it has to a metaverse, from its Quest VR platform, according to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/2026-vr-state-of-the-union-horizon-mobile-focus/\" target=\"_blank\">a new blog post</a> from Samantha Ryan, Meta's VP of Content, Reality Labs. While the decision runs counter to Meta's original plan to own an immersive virtual world that could serve as the future home for all online interaction, it fits with <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-refocuses-on-ai-hardware-as-metaverse-layoffs-begin-145924706.html\" target=\"_blank\">the recent cuts</a> it made to its costly Reality Labs division, and Mark Zuckerberg's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/mark-zuckerberg-says-reality-labs-will-eventually-stop-losing-so-much-money-222900157.html\" target=\"_blank\">public commitment</a> to focus the company on AI hardware like smart glasses going forward.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We’re explicitly separating our Quest VR platform from our Worlds platform in order to create more space for both products to grow,&quot; Ryan writes in the blog post. &quot;We’re doubling down on the VR developer ecosystem while shifting the focus of Worlds to be almost exclusively mobile. By breaking things down into two distinct platforms, we’ll be better able to clearly focus on each.&quot;</p><p>Meta has been developing <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/meta-starts-testing-horizon-worlds-on-mobile-and-the-web-114028350.html\" target=\"_blank\">mobile and web versions of Horizon Worlds</a> in parallel with its VR app since at least 2023. Switching Worlds to being a mobile-first software platform isn't good for VR diehards, but it does make it a more natural competitor to something like <em>Roblox</em> or <em>Fortnite</em>, which also offer user-created and monetizable worlds and games. It's also a business Meta believes it can more easily scale because of its ability to connect games to &quot;billions of people on the world’s biggest social networks.&quot;</p><p>While Meta shuttered <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/meta-has-closed-three-vr-studios-as-part-of-its-metaverse-cuts-202720670.html\" target=\"_blank\">several of its own VR game studios</a> earlier this year, it still wants to support third-party developers publishing games on its platform. The company says new monetization tools, better discoverability, a &quot;Deals&quot; tab and more ways for developers to talk to their customers should help make a difference. Maintaining the Quest's library of games could also be critical going forward. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-delays-new-mixed-reality-glasses-code-named-phoenix-2025-12\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Business Insider </em>reported</a> in December 2025 that Meta was working on a gaming-focused Quest headset, and Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M5Gz0xQd8c\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> earlier this February that the company still had multiple Quest devices on its roadmap.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/metas-metaverse-is-going-mobile-first-233030532.html?src=rss",

Despite its compact, curvy size, it also boasts a 6.1-ft-peak (1.9-m) cabin with a private bath and convertible dinette. As with other RVs, though, Barefoot pricing has risen steadily and is now close to double what it was 11 years ago. Happily, Barefoot has developed the new Bothy model to roll pricing back in time while simplifying the layout into a lighter, more spacious offering. It's a compelling entry point to the egg-camping experience.</p><p><a href=\"https://newatlas.com/camping-trailers/barefoot-bothy-lightweight-egg-camper/\">Continue Reading</a></p><p><b>Category:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/camping-trailers/\">Camping Trailers</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/adventure-vehicles/\">Adventure Vehicles</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/outdoors/\">Outdoors</a></p><p><b>Tags:</b> <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/caravan/\" rel=\"tag\">Caravan</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/teardrop-trailers/\" rel=\"tag\">teardrop trailers</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/trailers/\" rel=\"tag\">trailers</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/outdoor/\" rel=\"tag\">Outdoors and Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/camping/\" rel=\"tag\">Camping</a>, <a href=\"https://newatlas.com/tag/rv/\" rel=\"tag\">RV</a></p>",

Bluepoint's last major project was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-ps5-162534113.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>God of War: Ragnarok</em></a> from 2022, which it co-developed with Sony Santa Monica.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Sony decided to shut down the studio following &quot;a recent business review.&quot; Around 70 employees will lose their jobs as part of the studio closure, which will officially happen in March. &quot;Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,&quot; Sony said in a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>. &quot;We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship.&quot;</p><p>Following their work on <em>Ragnarok</em>, Bluepoint was reportedly tasked with developing a live-service game set in the God of War universe. That title <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-axes-two-more-live-service-games-130048000.html\" target=\"_blank\">was cancelled</a> in 2025, alongside another game from Bend Studio. In the context of Sony's other live-service failures, the decision wasn't surprising. Sony shut down the servers for multiplayer shooter <em>Concord</em> just two weeks after its release. Not long after, it also closed <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-pulls-the-plug-on-concord-and-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-180321212.html\" target=\"_blank\">Firewalk Studios</a>, the developer behind the game.</p><p>Bluepoint Games was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-155507719.html\" target=\"_blank\">originally acquired</a> by Sony in 2021, when it seemed like the studio's expertise in remaking and remastering classic PlayStation games could be a major asset going forward. Why that changed isn't entirely clear, but Sony's mismanagement of its pivot into and out of publishing premium online multiplayer games may have played a role. Some of Sony's studios are still experimenting with live-service mechanics. Guerilla Games recently announced <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/guerrilla-reveals-horizon-hunters-gathering-a-co-op-action-spin-off-for-ps5-and-pc-162058264.html\" target=\"_blank\">an online co-op game</a> set in its Horizon universe. <em>Destiny 2 </em>developer Bungie is also releasing its extraction shooter <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/bungies-marathon-arrives-on-march-5-193808588.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Marathon</em></a> in March. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/sony-is-shutting-down-the-studio-behind-the-demons-souls-remake-195234213.html?src=rss",

They managed to disrupt Finland&#8217;s political order through threats of violence and symbolic kidnappings, in which they would capture political rivals and drive them to the Soviet border.</p>\n\t<p>They earned the support of center-right and moderate politicians who believed they could harness the passion and support of this radical nationalist group. The movement also included prominent businessmen, newspaper owners, and key members of the military.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>But after a few years, the country was able to right the ship:</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Almost overnight, the Lapua movement collapsed. Within three years of its founding, this far-right faction was banned from Finnish politics, and democracy in Finland has been stable ever since.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>You can read more about the Lapua movement and how it was defeated in <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/democracys-near-misses/\">this article about democracy&#8217;s &#8220;near misses&#8221;</a>.</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>In November 1929, red-shirted communist youth paraded in the small Finnish village of Lapua, located in the country&#8217;s religious and conservative southern Ostrobothnian region. An angry mob of local farmers attacked the parade, stripped the participants of their shirts, and began beating the unlucky leftists. That seemingly isolated and chance incident sparked a &#8220;a series of events which proved almost fatal to parliamentary government in Finland.</p></blockquote>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/Finland\">Finland</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/politics\">politics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>",

That said, there were a ton of cool new products on display at the Javits Center in New York City that set the stage for the rest of the year, so here's a quick look at some of the most interesting releases from the largest toy show in the Western Hemisphere.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-transformers-the-movie-40th-anniversary-figures-28-to-60\"><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/collections/the-transformers-the-movie\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Transformers: The Movie </em>40th anniversary figures</a> ($28 to $60)</h2><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>To celebrate the 40th anniversary of <em>Transformers: The Movie</em>, Hasbro is launching an <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U62UyYw7ek\" target=\"_blank\">apology tour</a> to make up for traumatizing theatergoers with the death of the most beloved Autobot back in 1986. To kick things off, Hasbro is releasing a handful of new figures alongside re-releases for some popular bots including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/transformers-studio-series-the-transformers-the-movie-leader-class-astrotrain/G21905X00?srsltid=AfmBOoqfDHC5xVvWabTc6P-MfWUbaUkgH8TozCODjikqwPM-agrTAHrB\" target=\"_blank\">Astrotrain</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/transformers-studio-series-the-transformers-the-movie-voyager-class-skywarp/G19315X00?srsltid=AfmBOorJcUnsU1uK8BaUEnGKRoN7gCwBY6ArYBsccQtCQXJhl5z7bzE6\" target=\"_blank\">Skywarp</a>, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/transformers-studio-series-the-transformers-the-movie-leader-class-dinobot-snarl/G21885X00?srsltid=AfmBOopQzlhPkzfCcba4nQnstDA-lcJueg0JY52RBm5Sh9cMatsQIUg9\" target=\"_blank\">Snarl</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.hasbropulse.com/product/transformers-studio-series-the-transformers-the-movie-voyager-class-shockwave/G21915X00?cgid=the-transformers-the-movie\" target=\"_blank\">Shockwave</a>.

    "title": "Orbital AI data centers could work, but they might ruin Earth in the process",
    "description": "<p>At the start of the month, Elon Musk announced that two of his companies — SpaceX and xAI&nbsp; — <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/elon-musks-spacex-has-acquired-his-ai-company-xai-221617040.html\" target=\"_blank\">were merging</a>, and would jointly launch a constellation of 1 million satellites to operate as orbital data centers. Musk's reputation might suggest otherwise, but according to experts, such a plan isn't a complete fantasy.

In space, there are no clouds or weather events to obscure the sun, and in the correct orbit, solar panels can collect sunlight through much of the day. In combination with declining rocket launch costs and the price of powering AI data centers on Earth, Musk <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.spacex.com/updates\" target=\"_blank\">has said</a> that within three years space will be the cheapest way to generate AI compute power.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of the billionaire's announcement, SpaceX filed an <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cc8a75f0-b695-4a6a-a33c-41019f4bfaa4&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=be369cf6-5cd7-455d-98e2-649734bde3b1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Scribd&amp;linkText=eight-page+application&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JpYmQuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50Lzk5MDExNjgyNi9PcmJpdGFsLURhdGEtQ2VudGVyLUxPQS1OYXJyYXRpdmUiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImJlMzY5Y2Y2LTVjZDctNDU1ZC05OGUyLTY0OTczNGJkZTNiMSIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2NyaWJkLmNvbS9kb2N1bWVudC85OTAxMTY4MjYvT3JiaXRhbC1EYXRhLUNlbnRlci1MT0EtTmFycmF0aXZlIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAX1IkVGjrrhjZAOqwE3nUBr3M0565gMjo_wG5X4ReBzY&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F990116826%2FOrbital-Data-Center-LOA-Narrative\" target=\"_blank\">eight-page application</a> with the Federal Communications Commission detailing his plan. The company hopes to deposit the satellites in this massive cluster in altitudes ranging between 500km and 2000km. They would communicate with one another and SpaceX's Starlink constellation using laser &quot;optical links.&quot; Those Starlink satellites would then transmit inference requests to and from Earth. To power the entire effort, SpaceX has proposed putting the new constellation in sun-synchronous orbit, meaning the spacecraft would fly along the dividing line that separates the day and night sides of the planet.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-a-data-center-would-endure-in-orbit\">What a data center would endure in orbit</h2><p>Almost immediately the plan was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46876105\" target=\"_blank\">greeted with skepticism</a>. How would SpaceX, for instance, cool millions of GPUs in space? At first glance, that might seem like a weird point to get hung up on — much of space being around -450 Fahrenheit — but the reality is more complicated. In the near vacuum of space, the only way to dissipate heat is to slowly radiate it out, and in direct sunlight, objects can easily overheat. As one commenter on <em>Hacker News </em>succinctly put it, &quot;a satellite is, if nothing else, a fantastic thermos.&quot;</p><p>Scott Manley, who, before he created one of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@scottmanley/featured\" target=\"_blank\">most popular space-focused channels</a> on YouTube, was a software engineer and studied computational physics and astronomy, argues SpaceX has already solved that problem at a smaller scale with Starlink. He points to the company's latest V3 model, which has about 30 square meters of solar panels. &quot;They have a bunch of electronics in the middle, which are taking that power and doing stuff with it. Now, some of that power is being beamed away as radio waves, but there's a lot of thermal power that's being generated and then having to be dissipated. So they already have a platform that's running electronics off of power, and so it's not a massive leap to turn into something doing compute.&quot;</p><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 692px; width: 640px; height: 692px;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The larger V3 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Starlink?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Starlink</a> satellites that will deploy from Starship will bring gigabit connectivity to users and are designed to add 60 Tera-bits-per-second of downlink capacity to the Starlink network.<br /><br />That's more than 20 times the capacity added with every V2 Mini launch on… <a href=\"https://t.co/N0Vl9psbm3\">pic.twitter.com/N0Vl9psbm3</a></p>— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1977873370688700846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>\n\n\n</div><p>Kevin Hicks, a former NASA systems engineer who worked on the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/nasa-explains-how-it-keeps-the-curiosity-rover-running-13-years-later-124530184.html\" target=\"_blank\">Curiosity rover</a> mission, is more skeptical. &quot;Satellites with the primary goal of processing large amounts of compute requests would generate more heat than pretty much any other type of satellite,&quot; he said. &quot;Cooling them is another aspect of the design which is theoretically possible but would require a ton of extra work and complexity, and I have doubts about the durability of such a cooling system.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>What about radiation then? There's a reason NASA relies on ancient hardware like the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/nasa-perseverance-powerpc-750-171516292.html\" target=\"_blank\">PowerPC 750 CPU found inside the Perseverance rover</a>: Older chips feature larger transistors, making them more resilient to bit flips — errors in processing caused most often by cosmic radiation — that might scramble a computation. &quot;Binary ones and zeroes are about the presence or absence of electrons, and the amount of charge required to represent a 'one' goes down as the transistors get smaller and smaller,&quot; explains <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~leebcc/\" target=\"_blank\">Benjamin Lee</a>, professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania. Space is full of energized particles traveling at incredible velocities, and the latest GPUs are built on the smallest, most advanced processing nodes to create transistor-dense silicon. Not a great combination.</p><p>&quot;My concern about radiation is that we don't know how many bit flips will occur when you deploy the most advanced chips and hundreds of gigabytes of memory up there,&quot; said Professor Lee, pointing to preliminary research by Google on the subject. As part of <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://research.google/blog/exploring-a-space-based-scalable-ai-infrastructure-system-design/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Suncatcher</a>, its own effort to explore the viability of space-based data centers, the company put one of its <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=53056deb-0e54-4c87-964d-2e7d085829e8&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=be369cf6-5cd7-455d-98e2-649734bde3b1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Google+Cloud+-+North+America&amp;linkText=Trillium+TPUs&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Nsb3VkLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vYmxvZy9wcm9kdWN0cy9jb21wdXRlL2ludHJvZHVjaW5nLXRyaWxsaXVtLTZ0aC1nZW4tdHB1cyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYmUzNjljZjYtNWNkNy00NTVkLTk4ZTItNjQ5NzM0YmRlM2IxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Nsb3VkLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vYmxvZy9wcm9kdWN0cy9jb21wdXRlL2ludHJvZHVjaW5nLXRyaWxsaXVtLTZ0aC1nZW4tdHB1cyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAATpQLwSrPcfHE_SRLVDzekn8JBWhERUr7vsqs98bOpZ-&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Fblog%2Fproducts%2Fcompute%2Fintroducing-trillium-6th-gen-tpus\" target=\"_blank\">Trillium TPUs</a> in front of a proton beam to bombard it with radiation. It found the silicon was &quot;surprisingly radiation-hard for space applications.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>While those results were promising, Professor Lee points out we just don't know how resilient GPUs are to radiation at this scale. &quot;Even though modern computer architectures can detect and sometimes correct for those errors, having to do that again and again will slow down or add overhead to space-based computation,&quot; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Space engineer <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://andrewmccalip.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew McCalip</a>, who's done a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://andrewmccalip.com/space-datacenters\" target=\"_blank\">deep dive on the economics</a> of orbital data centers, is more optimistic, pointing to the natural resilience of AI models. &quot;They don't require 100 percent perfect error-free runs. They're inherently very noisy, very stochastic,&quot; he explains, adding that part of the training for modern AI systems involves &quot;<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deep-learning/noise-injection-for-training-artificial-neural-networks/\" target=\"_blank\">injecting random noise into different layers</a>.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if SpaceX could harden its GPUs against radiation, the company would still lose satellites to GPUs that break down. If you know anything about data centers here on Earth, it's that they require constant maintenance. Components like SSDs and GPUs die all the time. Musk has claimed SpaceX's AI satellites would require &quot;<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.spacex.com/updates\" target=\"_blank\">little</a>&quot; in the way of operating or maintenance costs. That's only true if you accept the narrowest possible interpretation of what maintaining a fleet of AI satellites would entail.</p><p>&quot;I think that there's no case in which repair makes sense. It's a fly till you die scenario,&quot; says McCalip. From an economic perspective, McCalip argues the projected death rate of GPUs in space represents &quot;one of the biggest uncertainties&quot; of the orbital data center model. McCalip's put that number at nine percent on the basis of a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/faulty-nvidia-h100-gpus-and-hbm3-memory-caused-half-of-the-failures-during-llama-3-training-one-failure-every-three-hours-for-metas-16384-gpu-training-cluster\" target=\"_blank\">study</a> Meta published following the release of its Llama 3 model (which, incidentally, measured hardware failures on Earth.) But the reality is no one knows what the attrition rate of those chips will be until they're in space.&nbsp;</p><p>Orbital data centers also likely wouldn't be a direct replacement for their terrestrial counterparts. SpaceX's application specifically mentions inference as the primary use case for its new constellation. Inference is the practical side of running an AI system. It sees a model apply its learning to data it hasn't seen before, like a prompt you write in ChatGPT, to make predictions and generate content. In other words, AI models would still need to be trained on Earth, and it's not clear that the process could be offloaded to a constellation of satellites. &quot;My initial thinking is that computations that require a lot of coordination, like AI training, may end up being tricky to get right at scale up there,&quot; says Professor Lee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-kessler-syndrome\">Kessler syndrome</h2><p>In 1978, a pair of NASA scientists proposed a scenario where low Earth orbit could become so dense with space junk that collisions between those objects would begin to cascade. That scenario is known as <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\" target=\"_blank\">Kessler syndrome</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>One estimate from satellite tracking website <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://orbit.ing-now.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Orbiting Now</a> puts the number of objects in orbit around the planet at approximately 15,600. Another estimate from NASA suggests there are 45,000 human-made objects orbiting Earth. No matter the number, what's currently in orbit represents a fraction of the 1 million additional satellites Musk wants to launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>According to Aaron Boley, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of British Columbia and co-director of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://outerspaceinstitute.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Outer Space Institute</a>, forward-looking modeling of Earth's orbit above 700 kilometers — where part of SpaceX's proposed cluster would live — suggests that area of space is already showing signs of Kessler syndrome.&nbsp;</p><p>While it takes less time for debris to clear in low Earth orbit, Professor Boley says there's already enough material in that region of space where there could be a cascading effect from a major collision. Debris could, in a worst case scenario, take a decade to clear up. In turn, that could lead to disruptions in global communications, climate monitoring missions and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;You could get to the point where you're just launching material in, and you could ask yourself how many satellites can I afford to lose? Can you reconstitute your constellation faster than you're losing parts of it because of debris?&quot; says Boley. &quot;That's a horrible future in terms of the environmental perspective&quot; In particular, it would limit opportunities for humans to fly into low Earth orbit. &quot;Could you operate in it? Yeah, but it would come with higher and higher costs,&quot; adds Boley.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The entire world is struggling with the problem of how we safely fly multiple mega constellations,&quot; says Richard DalBello, who previously ran the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/traffic-coordination-system-for-space-tracss/\" target=\"_blank\">Traffic Coordination System for Space</a> (TraCSS) at the US Department of Commerce. Right now, there is no common global space situational awareness (SSA) system, and government and satellite operators are using uncoordinated national and commercial systems that are likely producing different results. At the start of the year, SpaceX <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/science/space/starlink-is-lowering-thousands-of-satellites-orbits-to-reduce-risk-of-collisions-030509067.html\" target=\"_blank\">lowered the orbit</a> of thousands of Starlink satellites after one of them nearly collided with a Chinese satellite.&nbsp;</p><p>SpaceX has its own in-house SSA system called <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://starlink.com/updates/stargaze?srsltid=AfmBOooW5gJOA0z_WD05jxBfWpgwOrIaDMy4uAldZs6BLCk1A_jgtydN\" target=\"_blank\">Stargaze</a>, which it uses to fly its more than 7,000 Starlink satellites. According to DalBello, competing operators can receive SSA data from SpaceX, but to do so they must share their satellite position information. “Assuming data sharing, it is likely Stargaze can make an important contribution to spaceflight safety&quot; says DalBello. “SpaceX is likely to have success with US and other commercial operators, but without the assistance of the federal government, other governments — particularly China — will likely be unwilling to share their satellite and SSA data.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>According to DalBello, the Biden administration was unable to make meaningful progress on the next-generation TraCSS system, in part because Congress was initially reluctant to fund the program. Meanwhile, the current Trump administration hasn't shown interest in advancing the work that <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://space.commerce.gov/president-signs-space-traffic-management-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">began during the president's first term</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if the regulatory situation suddenly changes and the world's governments agree on an international SSA system, SpaceX launching 1 million satellites along the day-night terminator would see the company effectively monopolize one of the Earth's most valuable and important orbits. Professor Boley argues we should view our planet's orbits as a resource that belongs to everyone. &quot;Every time you put a satellite up, you use part of that resource. Now someone else can't use it.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>And as Hicks points out, even a single cascade of colliding satellites would prevent that space from being used for scientific endeavors. &quot;You would have to wait years for that debris to slowly come back into the atmosphere and burn up. In the meantime, that debris is taking up space that could be used for climate monitoring missions or any other types of missions that governments want to launch.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-a-blow-to-the-atmosphere\">A blow to the atmosphere</h2><p>Separately, the constant churn of Starship launches and re-entry of dead satellites would have a potentially dire impact on our planet's atmosphere. &quot;We're not prepared for it,&quot; Boley flatly says of the latter. &quot;We're not prepared for what's happening now, and what's happening now is already potentially bad.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>According to Musk's &quot;<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.spacex.com/updates\" target=\"_blank\">basic math</a>,&quot; SpaceX could add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually by launching a million tons of satellite per year. McCalip estimates a 100-gigawatt buildout alone would necessitate about 25,000 Starship flights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the metals found in satellites, including aluminum, magnesium and lithium, in combination with the exhaust rockets release into the atmosphere, can have complicated effects on the health of the planet. For instance, they can affect polar cloud formations, which in turn can facilitate ozone layer destruction through the chemical reactions that occur on their surfaces. According to Boley, the problem is we just don't know how severe those environmental factors could become at the scale Musk has proposed, and SpaceX has provided us with precious few details on its mitigation plans. All it has said is that its plan would &quot;achieve transformative cost and energy efficiency while significantly reducing the environmental impact associated with terrestrial data centers.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if SpaceX could and does go out its way to mitigate the atmospheric effects of constant rocket flights, those spacecraft still need to be manufactured here on Earth. At one of his previous roles, Hicks studied rocket emissions and found the supply chains needed to build them produce an &quot;order of magnitude&quot; more carbon emissions than the rockets themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>SpaceX plans to fly its new satellites in a sun-synchronous orbit, meaning for much of the year, they'll be sunlit. Each new Starlink generation has been larger and heavier than the one before it, with SpaceX stating in a <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=cc8a75f0-b695-4a6a-a33c-41019f4bfaa4&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=be369cf6-5cd7-455d-98e2-649734bde3b1&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Scribd&amp;linkText=recent+filing&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY3JpYmQuY29tL2RvY3VtZW50LzgwMzY5MTA3Ny9Bbm5leC1DLTEtU3BhY2V4IiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJiZTM2OWNmNi01Y2Q3LTQ1NWQtOThlMi02NDk3MzRiZGUzYjEiLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmliZC5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvODAzNjkxMDc3L0FubmV4LUMtMS1TcGFjZXgifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAU2Wi9FCYAkjWhnNVAJD2MPZEKmGnPFLtsVwLMfKDEDl&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F803691077%2FAnnex-C-1-Spacex\" target=\"_blank\">recent filing</a> that its upcoming V3 model could weigh up to 2,000 kilograms, up from the 575 kilograms of the V2 Mini Optimized. While we don't know the exact dimensions of the company's still-hypothetical AI satellites, they will almost certainly be bigger than their Starlink counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>SpaceX has done more than most space operators to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://starlink.com/public-files/BrightnessMitigationBestPracticesSatelliteOperators.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOor4HRcE5M1eLBRG_Q6D8kUQSW835zQoIziR_pQCJEt7r9FUeWtN\" target=\"_blank\">reduce the brightness of its satellites</a>, but Professor Boley says he expects that this new constellation will be &quot;strikingly bright&quot; when moving through the night sky. In aggregate, he estimates they will almost certainly be harmful to scientific research here on Earth, limiting what terrestrial observatories can see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;You're going to see them with the naked eye. You're going to see them with cameras. It's going to be like living near an airport where you see all these things flying over just after sunset and the next couple of hours after sunset,&quot; says Manley. &quot;I don't know if I want to have my entire sunset be just a band of satellites constantly shooting overhead.&quot;</p><p>There are good reasons to make some spacecraft capable of doing AI inference. For instance, Professor Lee suggests it would make orbital imaging satellites more useful, as those spacecraft could do on-site analysis, instead of sending high-resolution files over long distances, saving time in the process. But the dose, as they say, makes the poison.</p><p>&quot;There's a lot of excitement about the many possibilities that can be brought to society and humanity through continued access to space, but the promise of prosperity is not permission to be reckless,&quot; he says. &quot;At this moment, we're allowing that excitement to overtake that more measured progression [...] those impacts don't just impact outer space but Earth as well.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/orbital-ai-data-centers-could-work-but-they-might-ruin-earth-in-the-process-170000099.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>The office of the Attorney General for West Virginia <a href=\"https://ago.wv.gov/article/west-virginia-attorney-general-sues-apple-role-distribution-child-sexual-abuse-material\"><ins>announced Thursday</ins></a> that it has filed a <a href=\"https://ago.wv.gov/sites/default/files/2026-02/Filing.pdf\"><ins>lawsuit</ins></a> against Apple alleging that the company had &quot;knowingly&quot; allowed its iCloud platform &quot;to be used as a vehicle for distributing and storing child sexual abuse material.&quot; The state alleges this went on for years but drew no action from the tech giant &quot;under the guise of user privacy.&quot;</p>\n<p>In the lawsuit, the state repeatedly cites <a href=\"https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21044004-2020-february-fear-friedman-admits-in-feb-2020-that-app-store-greatest-platform-for-child-porn-predator-grooming/#document/p17\"><ins>a text</ins></a> from Apple executive Eric Friedman, in which he calls iCloud &quot;the greatest platform for distributing child porn&quot; in a conversation with another Apple executive. These messages were first uncovered by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs\"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> in 2021 within discovery documents for the Epic Games v. Apple trial. In the conversation, Friedman says while some other platforms prioritize safety over privacy, Apple's priorities &quot;are the inverse.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The state further alleges that detection technology to help root out and report CSAM exists, but that Apple chooses not to implement it. Apple indeed considered <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-csam-detection-explainer-183029927.html\"><ins>scanning iCloud Photos for CSAM</ins></a> in 2021, but <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apple-advanced-data-protection-imessage-contact-key-183819737.html\"><ins>abandoned these plans</ins></a> after pushback stemming from privacy concerns.</p>\n<p>In 2024 Apple was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/apple-sued-for-failing-to-implement-tools-that-would-detect-csam-in-icloud-202940984.html\"><ins>sued</ins></a> by a group of over 2,500 victims of child sexual abuse, citing nearly identical claims and alleging that Apple's failure to implement these features led to the victims' harm as images of them circulated through the company's servers. At the time Apple told Engadget, “child sexual abuse material is abhorrent and we are committed to fighting the ways predators put children at risk. We are urgently and actively innovating to combat these crimes without compromising the security and privacy of all our users.&quot;</p>\n<p>The case in West Virginia would mark the first time a governmental body is bringing such an action against the iPhone maker. The state says it is seeking injunctive relief that would compel Apple to implement effective CSAM detection measures as well as damages. We have reached out to Apple for comment on the suit and will update if we hear back.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/west-virginia-is-suing-apple-alleging-negligence-over-csam-materials-164647648.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Nintendo announces surprise Switch 2 version of sci-fi RPG Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition",
    "description": "<p>Last year’s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-heads-to-the-switch-on-march-20-171622499.html\"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>was significant for a few reasons. It was the final major first-party Switch game ahead of the Switch 2’s arrival in June, and the last doomed Wii U game to be granted a second life on Nintendo’s infinitely more successful console. Nearly a year on, a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2-review-more-of-what-you-love-120048430.html\">Switch 2</a> update for one of the most technically impressive games Nintendo has ever published has finally arrived.</p>\n<p>Somewhat hilariously titled <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition </em>(you get the feeling Nintendo has started a naming convention it may come to regret here), the updated version of Monolith Soft’s sprawling sci-fi RPG now supports up to 60fps performance and 4K resolution when docked to a TV.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"51c7c26b0f22447683787b31105b2673\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The sprawling alien world of planet Mira, now enhanced on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NintendoSwitch2</a> with improved frame rates and up to 4K resolution in TV mode!<br /><br />Join the fight for survival in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/XenobladeChroniclesX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#XenobladeChroniclesX</a>: Definitive Edition – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, available now! <a href=\"https://t.co/raA1XhIimC\">pic.twitter.com/raA1XhIimC</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2024484113923571725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 19, 2026</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>As impressive as the Switch remake of the 2015 Wii U game was, given the frankly absurd size of its open-world setting, you could almost feel the hardware creaking under its weight every time you booted the game up, so this patch was much-needed. Unfortunately the graphical and performance enhancements aren’t free for anyone who already owns the Switch version of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>. A $5 upgrade pack is available on the eShop, and the Switch 2 game costs $65 on its own. A physical version is also arriving on April 16.</p>\n<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition </em>(again, won’t someone please think of us writers) was the last of a number of Xenoblade Chronicles games to make its way to Switch. It’s a bit different to the other entries in the series, with its hard sci-fi story, emphasis on side quests and completely seamless open world to explore. Also, stick with the game long enough and you can eventually fly around the entire planet of Mira in a giant mech, which is as fun as it sounds.</p>\n<p>Like the other games in the series, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>is a standalone experience, so don’t worry about jumping in if you’ve never played one before. The series’ signature MMO-like hybrid real-time combat system takes a bit of getting used to, but it’s part of what makes these games stand out from other RPG series.</p>\n<p>The other Xenoblade games in the Switch library, which are <em>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition</em>, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>, are yet to receive Switch 2 updates, but hopefully they'll arrive eventually too.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendo-announces-surprise-switch-2-version-of-sci-fi-rpg-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-153121689.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-100230748-15834536?sid=1234\" target=\"_blank\">Proton VPN</a> is running a solid deal right now, dropping its two-year Proton VPN Plus plan to $2.99 per month. That works out to $72 billed upfront for the first 24 months, which represents a 70 percent discount compared to its regular pricing.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">rated Proton VPN highly</a> thanks to its strong privacy credentials, transparent nonprofit backing and consistently fast performance. It’s one of the services we recommend in our guide to the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPNs</a>, and this deal also shows up alongside other standout offers in our ongoing roundup of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html\" target=\"_blank\">best VPN deals</a>. It’s a good option if you’re looking to lock in long-term protection at a lower monthly cost.</p><p></p><p>In our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/proton-vpn-review-2025-a-nonprofit-service-with-premium-performance-153046073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Proton VPN review</a>, the service impressed us with consistently fast performance and strong privacy protections. We measured average download speeds at 88 percent of our unprotected connection and upload speeds at 98 percent, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming and torrenting. It also unblocked Netflix in every region we tested, and while its Mac and iOS apps aren’t quite as polished as the Windows and Android versions, the service is still easy to install and largely set-it-and-forget-it across platforms. We gave Proton VPN a score of 90 out of 100.</p><p>Proton VPN Plus is the company’s premium tier and includes access to its full server network, which now spans more than 15,000 servers across 120-plus countries. A single subscription covers up to 10 devices at once and unlocks features like NetShield ad and malware blocking, Secure Core “double hop” connections, split tunneling, custom DNS controls and priority customer support. Proton VPN Plus also supports fast P2P traffic on nearly all paid servers and includes VPN Accelerator, which helps maintain high speeds over long-distance connections.</p><p>Right now, Proton VPN Plus is discounted to $2.99 per month when you commit to two years, billed as $72 upfront for the first 24 months. After that, the plan renews annually at $83.88. That’s a 70 percent discount compared to the standard monthly rate. As with Proton’s other paid plans, the subscription comes with a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-proton-vpn-and-get-a-refund-170014128.html\" target=\"_blank\">30-day money-back guarantee</a>, so you can try it risk-free if you’re not ready to lock in long term.</p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/proton-vpn-two-year-subscriptions-are-70-percent-off-right-now-123000972.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>We found the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> to have a pretty decent battery life for such a thin-and-light phone, somewhere in the region of 27 hours if you’re continuously streaming video. But it's still a phone, arguably your most used device on a daily basis, so you may need to top it up during the day if you're using it constantly. That’s where Apple’s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFH9BST&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b81fb587-99ff-4a0a-8491-b9b9460d3e9a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=iPhone+Air+MagSafe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjgxZmI1ODctOTlmZi00YTBhLTg0OTEtYjliOTQ2MGQzZTlhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1QiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR9o3Bk1eGEoY_MpvpdVaX8WwrXHv-kJY6NrXwaRfhTy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFH9BST\">iPhone Air MagSafe</a> battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

You just follow the instructions on your iPhone, paying attention to the vibrations that signal you’re getting closer.</p> \n<p>A reminder again that the above deals apply to the first-generation AirTag only.

    "description": "<p>If you're an iPhone user who likes to keep tabs on where your stuff is, you <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-bluetooth-tracker-140028377.html\">can't go far wrong with an AirTag</a>. The second-gen model that Apple just released <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\">outpaces the original</a> in every way (aside from the galling lack of a keyring hole, that is). While it's easy enough to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/how-to-replace-your-airtag-battery-130000463.html\">replace the battery</a> in both versions of the AirTag, you might not want to have to worry about the device's battery life for a very long time. Enter Elevation Lab's extended battery case for the AirTag, which is currently <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0D1LHBZGL&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=61f14f8b-e71c-4724-a1bf-0d7992632921&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=on+sale+at+Amazon+for+%2416&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDFMSEJaR0w_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiNjFmMTRmOGItZTcxYy00NzI0LWExYmYtMGQ3OTkyNjMyOTIxIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRDFMSEJaR0wiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAZ5tp9jRsXPC9KB06SrtQgpAFy3tN1LYQFPUDmeGSjg2&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1LHBZGL\">on sale at Amazon for $16</a>.</p> \n<p>The case usually sells for $23, so that's a 30 percent discount. It's not the first time <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-extended-battery-airtag-case-is-down-to-only-16-162308748.html\">we've seen this deal</a>, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This is arguably one of the more useful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag accessories</a> around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> \n<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> \n<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/grab-this-elevation-lab-10-year-extended-battery-case-for-airtag-for-only-16-151215800.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>Last year Dyson introduced the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/home/the-dyson-pencilvac-is-the-most-stick-like-stick-vacuum-ever-020109491.html\"><ins>PencilVac</ins></a>, which it immediately declared the &quot;world’s slimmest vacuum cleaner.&quot; Presumably, then, the title of world’s slimmest wet floor cleaner goes to the newly unveiled PencilWash.</p>\n<p>Promising a &quot;lighter, slimmer and smaller solution to wet cleaning without compromising on hygiene,&quot; the PencilWash is designed to let you clean everywhere you need to with minimal hassle. Like the vacuum cleaner with which it shares the first part of its name, the handle measures just 1.5 inches in diameter from top to bottom, and the whole thing weighs little more than 2kg.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The ultra-thin design allows the cleaner to lie almost completely flat, allowing you to get into tight corners or under low furniture, where more traditionally bulky devices might struggle. Its slender proportions also make it easier to store if your home is on the smaller side.</p>\n<p>Dyson says the PencilWash only applies fresh water to floors, and after swiftly eliminating spills and stains it should dry up pretty quickly. Its high-density microfiber roller is designed to tackle both wet and dry debris in one pass, and because it doesn’t have a traditional filter, you won’t have to worry about trapped dirt or lingering smells.</p>\n<p>Above the power buttons there’s a screen displaying remaining battery level, and the handle can be slotted into a charging dock when not in use.</p>\n<p>The Dyson PencilVac will cost $349, with a release date yet to be announced.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/dyson-announces-the-pencilwash-wet-floor-cleaner-230152299.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Gemini can now generate a 30-second approximation of what real music sounds like",
    "description": "<div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Google <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/gemini-app/lyria-3/\" target=\"_blank\">has announced</a> that using its newly incorporated Lyria 3 model, Gemini users will be able to generate 30-second music tracks based on a prompt, or remix an existing track to their liking. The new model builds on Gemini's pre-existing ability to generate text, images and video, and will also be available in YouTube's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/youtube-creators-can-now-make-ai-song-remixes-for-shorts-143015775.html\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Dream Track&quot;</a> feature, where it can be used to generate detailed backing tracks for Shorts.</p><p>Like some other music generation tools, prompting Gemini doesn't require a lot of detail to produce serviceable results. Google's example prompt is &quot;a comical R&amp;B slow jam about a sock finding their match,&quot; but after playing with Lyria 3, you can definitely get more granular about individual elements of a track — changing the tempo or the style of drumming, for example — if you want to. Outside of text, Gemini can also generate music based on a photo or video, and tracks can be paired with album art created by Google's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/googles-nano-banana-pro-image-generator-leverages-gemini-3-for-improved-visuals-and-text-rendering-185505073.html\" target=\"_blank\">Nano Banana image model</a>.</p><div><div style=\"width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\"></div></div><p>Google says that Lyria 3 improves on its previous audio generation models in its ability to create more &quot;realistic and musically complex&quot; tracks, give prompters more control over individual components of a song and automatically generate lyrics. Gemini's outputs are limited to 30-second clips for now, but given how Google's promotional video shows off the feature, it's not hard to imagine those clips getting longer or the model getting incorporated into other apps, like Google Messages.</p><p>Like Gemini's other AI-generated outputs, songs made with Lyria 3 are also watermarked with Google's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/google-wants-an-invisible-digital-watermark-to-bring-transparency-to-ai-art-164551794.html\" target=\"_blank\">SynthID</a>, so a Gemini clip can't as easily be passed off as a human one. Google started rolling out its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/synthid-detector-can-check-media-to-see-if-it-was-generated-with-googles-ai-tools-194002070.html\" target=\"_blank\">SynthID Detector</a> for identifying AI-generated content at Google I/O 2025. The sample tracks Google included alongside its announcement are convincing, but you might not need the company's tool to notice their machine-made qualities. The instrumental parts of Gemini’s clips often sound great, but the composition of the lyrics Lyria 3 produces sounds alternately corny and strange.</p><p>If you're curious to try Lyria 3 for yourself, Google says you can prompt tracks in Gemini starting today, provided you're 18 years or older and speak English, Spanish, German, French, Hindi, Japanese, Korean or Portuguese.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gemini-can-now-generate-a-30-second-approximation-of-what-real-music-sounds-like-204445903.html?src=rss",

Developer Sad Cat Studios notes that the game is &quot;technically finished&quot; but the team needs a few more weeks for polish. The company says it wants the day-one release to be &quot;polished, stable and true to the vision&quot; of the original concept. This is something to be commended, in my opinion, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/concords-disastrous-launch-reportedly-leads-to-its-directors-self-demotion-215515013.html\"><ins>given the sad state</ins></a> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-i-for-pc-is-a-buggy-mess-144036281.html\"><ins>of many game launches</ins></a> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-and-the-year-of-disappointing-pc-ports-141551209.html\"><ins>in recent years</ins></a>.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><div id=\"0a584589e06047d6b4a0a7947f7f09c6\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"zxx\"><a href=\"https://t.co/8BbiNxRqUb\">pic.twitter.com/8BbiNxRqUb</a></p>— REPLACED (@REPLACEDGame) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/REPLACEDGame/status/2024122392310591889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 18, 2026</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>This is just the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pixel-art-cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-delayed-again-this-time-until-spring-2026-182908044.html\"><ins>latest delay for the game</ins></a>. However, previous delays have been for a very good reason. The development team had to relocate from Belarus to Cyprus after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p>\n<p><em>Replaced</em> is an absolutely gorgeous-looking 2.5D platformer set in a dystopian alternative 1980s America. You play as an AI unwillingly trapped in a human body. There looks to be plenty of cinematic action, with a blurb promising a combination of &quot;precise melee strikes with satisfying ranged attacks.&quot;</p>\n<div id=\"89ba731d312f40098b369a3151620d4f\"></div>\n<p>The game will be available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC via Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG and the Microsoft Store. It'll also be a day-one Xbox Game Pass release.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cyberpunk-platformer-replaced-has-once-again-been-delayed-190621246.html?src=rss",

However, that would certainly help with the cost.

The price is likely to be somewhere in the $699 to $799 range, which is pretty nifty. However, I'd still go for an Air at $999. They are <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-inch-and-15-inch-review-minimal-upgrades-at-a-much-better-price-130002570.html\"><ins>absolute workhorses</ins></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-macbook-pro-with-m5-pro-and-max-chips\">MacBook Pro with M5 Pro and Max chips</h2>\n<p>It's likely that Apple will release more powerful MacBook Pro models this year and the timing seems to match up. <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/we-may-see-apples-new-ipads-and-macbooks-in-only-a-matter-of-weeks-192953977.html\"><ins>has suggested a March launch</ins></a> and the event is on March 4.</p>\n<p>The company has already released a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-pro-m5-14-inch-review-a-huge-graphics-upgrade-for-creators-and-gamers-170009179.html\"><ins>MacBook Pro with an M5 chip</ins></a>, but both the M5 Pro and Max are likely on the horizon.

Additionally, the new chiplet design would allow the M5 Pro and Max to raise the total number of CPU and GPU cores. The Max is expected to have more cores than the Pro.</p>\n<p>This idea is helped along by the fact that MacBook Pro M4 Max orders <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/macbooks/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-buyers-beware-you-might-face-huge-delays-getting-your-laptop-but-its-not-because-of-the-ram-crisis\"><ins>are currently delayed</ins></a>. This is typically the case with an outgoing model as stock dries up to make room for new releases. Also, the Pro and Max variants typically get announced in the Fall, so we are due.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-new-ipads\">New iPads</h2>\n<p>Rumors have been circulating that <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/tablets/ipad/dont-buy-a-new-ipad-just-yet-two-new-models-are-set-to-launch-soon-with-future-proofing-upgrades\"><ins>we are about to get new iPads</ins></a>, including an update to the base model and the Air. The standard model, which would be the 12th-gen release, is expected <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/ipad-2025-with-a16-review-no-apple-intelligence-no-problem-132641539.html\"><ins>to upgrade the A16 chip</ins></a> to an A18. This should also allow for the integration of Apple Intelligence tools, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/to-fix-apple-intelligence-apple-needs-to-be-honest-about-its-capabilities-130046256.html\"><ins>if that's your bag</ins></a>.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"An iPad.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/cd164fd0-0ced-11f1-afdb-0e719a64039a\" style=\"height: 1202px; width: 1880px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Nathan Ingraham for Engadget</div></figure>\n<p>As for that iPad Air, rumors suggest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3055278/2026-ipad-air-design-display-specs-release-price.html\"><ins>an upgrade to the M4 chip</ins></a> from the M3. An extremely light tablet with an M4 would be fairly notable in my estimation, as only the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ipad-pro-2024-review-so-very-nice-and-so-very-expensive-210012937.html\"><ins>newest iPad Pro has that chip</ins></a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-iphone-17e\">iPhone 17e</h2>\n<p>It was almost exactly a year ago that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-just-unveiled-the-iphone-16e-heres-how-it-compares-to-the-competition-171306637.html\"><ins>Apple announced the iPhone 16e</ins></a>, so you know what that means. It's time for a refresh. Recent reports have suggested that an announcement <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/the-iphone-17e-could-land-imminently-with-no-price-rise-but-it-might-barely-be-an-upgrade\"><ins>regarding the iPhone 17e is imminent</ins></a>, so this launch event seems like as good a place as any to reveal the latest <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/a-599-iphone-16e-is-a-cruel-joke-200507275.html\"><ins>&quot;budget-friendly&quot;</ins></a> smartphone.</p>\n<p>As for specs, Mark Gurman has suggested that it'll be <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-08/apple-readies-iphone-17e-new-siri-entry-level-ipad-ipad-air-and-macbook-pro-mldr3hpk?srnd=undefined\"><ins>getting an upgrade to the A19 chip</ins></a>, which is nice. Also, it could be getting MagSafe support. That sounds like an iterative upgrade, but the price is expected to remain steady at $599.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-possibilities\">Other Possibilities</h2>\n<p>The following stuff is less likely, though certainly possible. There have been rumors that <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/macs/the-apple-mac-roadmap-for-2025-and-2026-may-have-leaked-through-macos-tahoe-26\"><ins>Apple is currently preparing</ins></a> a revamped Studio Display and Mac Studio desktop. The reports suggest a release sometime in the first half of the year, and March is right in the middle of that timeframe.</p>\n<p>It's also possible that the company will reveal an upgrade to the <a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/apple-event-announced-in-new-york-for-march-4-iphone-17e-first-cheap-macbook-and-more\"><ins>MacBook Air with the M5 chip</ins></a>. Reports indicate that this is unlikely to happen during this event, but it is worth noting that the M4 Air came out in March of last year. In other words, it's a toss up.</p>\n<div id=\"4445be45f7a64c30bfdafd770d2c4801\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">The inclusion of Shanghai essentially rules out Siri, as expected, given the delays. <a href=\"https://t.co/mgNLR4qCYy\">https://t.co/mgNLR4qCYy</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/2023410166432137720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote>\n \n\n</div>\n<p>What's not a toss up?

This looks to be a hardware event, so any software updates will likely have to wait until WWDC this summer.

Founded by Elsie Cohen in 1931, the Academy specialized in international films that eschewed classic Hollywood narratives, highlighting works by now-famous directors like Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, François Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman, Andrzej Wajda, and Satyajit Ray. While these films now hold cult status for cinema aficionados, in the early to mid-20th century, art house remained a novel and daring form of cinema that few theaters showcased. </p>\n\t<p>Throughout his longstanding relationship with the Academy, Strausfeld created over 300 bold, predominantly single-color linocut compositions with a deceptively simple hand-printed feel.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"761\" src=\"https://kottke.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none//images/posts/01/img-48390-04.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></p>\n\t<p><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"760\" src=\"https://kottke.org/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=scale-down,width=1200,metadata=none//images/posts/01/img-48390-05.jpg\" width=\"1024\" /></p>\n\t<p>An accompanying book is available <a href=\"https://press.rit.edu/9781956313383/art-for-art-house/\">from RIT Press</a>.

    "title": "Google Pixel 10a vs. Pixel 9a: What's changed and which one should you buy?",
    "description": "<p>Now that pre-orders are open for the Google Pixel 10a, it’s time to see how it stacks up against last year’s <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9a-review-basic-in-just-the-right-way-130050005.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pixel 9a</a>. At first glance, the two phones look very similar, and that’s not a bad thing. Google hasn’t tried to reinvent its budget-friendly formula this year, sticking to the same compact design, clean software experience and camera-first approach that made the 9a such a good value.</p><p>Both phones share a lot in common, including 120Hz OLED displays, Google’s Tensor G4 chip, strong computational photography and seven years of OS and security updates. The actual differences are more incremental, including a moderately brighter, tougher display, improved Extreme Battery Saver longevity, slightly faster wireless charging and the addition of Satellite SOS. Importantly, Google is keeping the starting price the same as before, with both phones coming in at $499.</p><p>On paper, the Pixel 10a doesn’t dramatically rethink what an affordable Pixel should be, but it does offer meaningful upgrades for the same price. While we wait for a review unit to evaluate the Pixel 10a's day-to-day performance, here's a quick comparison of the spec sheets of the two devices to see what the new model brings.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-pixel-10a-vs-pixel-9a-design-and-display\">Pixel 10a vs Pixel 9a: Design and display</h2><p>There’s very little separating these two on performance. Both the Pixel 9a and Pixel 10a run Google’s Tensor G4 chip with 8GB of RAM and the same storage options, so day-to-day speed should feel virtually identical. The Pixel 10a ships with Android 16 out of the box, though the 9a can be updated to the same version.</p><p>Off the bat, the Pixel 10a doesn’t look dramatically different from the Pixel 9a, and that appears to be intentional. Google is sticking with the same compact, no-frills approach from the last few A-series Pixels, so you’re still getting a 6.3-inch OLED panel with a smooth 60–120Hz refresh rate and a clean, understated aesthetic.&nbsp;</p><p>The meaningful changes show up once you dig into the display specs. The Pixel 10a upgrades the cover glass from Corning Gorilla Glass 3 to Gorilla Glass 7i, which should offer better durability against drops and scratches over time. Brightness also gets a noticeable bump. The 9a topped out at 1,800 nits for HDR content and 2,700 nits at peak, while the 10a pushes that to 2,000 nits for HDR and up to 3,000 nits at peak brightness. In practice, that should make the Pixel 10a easier to read outdoors and a bit punchier when watching HDR video.</p><p>Contrast is improved as well. The Pixel 10a’s panel is rated at a contrast ratio of more than 2,000,000:1, doubling the already respectable figure on the Pixel 9a. That won’t radically change how the phone looks day to day, but it should translate to deeper blacks and slightly more depth in darker scenes, especially when streaming video or browsing photos at night.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-pixel-10a-vs-pixel-9a-cameras\">Pixel 10a vs Pixel 9a: Cameras</h2><p>On paper, the Pixel 10a’s camera hardware looks very familiar. Like the Pixel 9a, it uses a 48-megapixel main camera paired with a 13MP ultra-wide, and there’s no dedicated telephoto lens. Image quality, color science and low-light performance should therefore be similar between the two.</p><p>Where the Pixel 10a pulls ahead is in software features. Google has added a few camera tools that aren’t available on the Pixel 9a, even though the underlying hardware hasn’t changed much. One of those is Camera Coach, which debuted on last year’s Pixel 10 series and offers on-screen tips to help you frame shots better or adjust how you’re holding the phone. The Pixel 10a also gains Macro Focus, allowing you to get much closer to small subjects like plants or textures. In our <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9a-review-basic-in-just-the-right-way-130050005.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pixel 9a review</a>, we found the phone could capture solid close-up detail, but locking focus could be finicky at times, so a more dedicated macro mode should make those shots easier to nail.</p><p>Finally, there’s Auto Best Take, which automatically picks the best expressions from a burst of photos and combines them into a single image. The feature debuted on Google’s Pixel 10 lineup last year, and it’s especially handy for group shots where someone always seems to blink at the wrong moment. By bringing it to the 10a, Google is extending one of its more genuinely practical AI camera tricks to a cheaper phone.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-battery-life-and-charging\">Battery life and charging</h2><p>Both the Pixel 9a and Pixel 10a use a 5,100mAh battery and support the same 23W wired charging speeds. Where the Pixel 10a does pull ahead slightly is wireless charging. The Pixel 9a tops out at 7.5W, while the Pixel 10a supports wireless charging at up to 10W when used with Qi-certified Extended Power Profile (EPP) chargers, which are designed to deliver faster wireless power than basic Qi pads. The difference isn’t dramatic, but the Pixel 10a should charge a bit quicker on a compatible wireless stand when you’re in a pinch.</p><p>You’ll also get some extra hours in dire situations. When you activate Extreme Battery Saver, the Pixel 9a is rated for up to 100 hours, while the Pixel 10a extends that to up to 120 hours.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-the-pixel-10a-gets-satellite-sos\">The Pixel 10a gets Satellite SOS</h2><p>The biggest safety-related upgrade on the Pixel 10a is the addition of Satellite SOS. Because it uses a newer modem compared to the Pixel 9a’s Exynos Modem 5300, it is capable of tapping satellite networks when necessary. This allows the phone to contact emergency services when you’re outside of cellular or Wi-Fi coverage, which can be genuinely useful if you spend time hiking, traveling or driving in remote areas.</p><p>If you already own a Pixel 9a, there doesn’t appear to be a huge reason to upgrade. Day-to-day performance may feel almost identical, since both phones use the same Tensor G4 chip, the same amount of RAM and very similar camera hardware.</p><p>That said, the Pixel 10a does make a stronger case for first-time buyers or anyone upgrading from an older Pixel. The biggest differentiator, though, is Satellite SOS — it’s the one feature the Pixel 9a simply can’t match due to hardware limitations. At the same $499 starting price, the Pixel 10a is, on paper, the better long-term buy if you’re choosing between the two today.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-google-pixel-10a-vs-google-pixel-9a-specs-at-a-glance\">Google Pixel 10a vs. Google Pixel 9a: Specs at a glance</h2><table><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Spec</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Google Pixel 10a</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Google Pixel 9a</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Price</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>$499</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>$499</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Google Tensor G4, Titan M2 coprocessor</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Google Tensor G4, Titan M2 coprocessor</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Display</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>6.3-inch Actua display, 1080 x 2424 pOLED at 422.2 PPI, Gorilla Glass 7i</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>6.3-inch Actua display, 1080 x 2424 pOLED at 422.2 PPI, Corning Gorilla Glass 3</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>RAM</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>8GB</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Storage</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Battery</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>5,100mAh</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>5,100mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Wireless charging</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Up to 10W</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Up to 7.5W</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Rear camera</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>48MP wide, 13MP ultrawide, Super Res Zoom up to 8x</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>48MP wide, 13MP ultrawide, Super Res Zoom up to 8x</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Front camera</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>13MP selfie cam</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>13MP selfie cam</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>SIM</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Dual SIM (single nano SIM, eSIM)</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Dual SIM (single nano SIM, eSIM)</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth v6, NFC</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth v5.3, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>OS</strong></p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Launch with Android 16</p></td><td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Launch with Android 15</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10a-vs-pixel-9a-whats-changed-and-which-one-should-you-buy-150000786.html?src=rss",

Starting at just $499, you get a vivid 6.3-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and 3,000 nits of peak brightness, 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of onboard storage. The phone also features a durable aluminum frame along with a stronger Corning Gorilla Glass 7i panel in front and a composite plastic back with a lovely matte finish. As a nod towards sustainability, Google says the P10a's chassis is made from 100 percent recycled material, while the rear panel comes in at 81 percent. And just like its <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9a-review-basic-in-just-the-right-way-130050005.html\" target=\"_blank\">predecessor</a>, you still get an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and the same battery capacity (5,100mAh) — except now it charges even faster, both wired (30 watts, up from 23) and wirelessly (10 watts, up from 5).</p><figure><img alt=\"While lavender is the new hero color for the Pixel 10a, berry is the hue I'd pick. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/pixel-10a-colors.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>While lavender is the new hero color for the Pixel 10a, berry is the hue I'd pick. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>The one place where the Pixel 10a might come up a touch short is that unlike its more expensive siblings, it features an older Tensor G4 processor instead of the Tensor G5 chip used on the main <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-10-review-170041718.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pixel 10 line</a>. Google says the decision to go with an older SoC is due to budget constraints. While it might not be the first choice for gamers or power users, I've never really had an issue with the day-to-day performance of Google's recent homegrown silicon.</p><p>However, even with a one-year-old chip, Google found a way to port over three flagship features to the Pixel A series for the first time. Camera Coach uses AI to help you compose and come up with more interesting shots. Meanwhile, Auto Best Take is designed to ensure that everyone in a group shot ends up with their finest expression. Finally, Satellite SOS allows you to call for help during emergencies, even when you don't have proper cell service.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"Satellite SOS support is one of three new features coming to the Google's A-series phones for the first time. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/pixel-10a-sos.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>Satellite SOS support is one of three new features coming to the Google's A-series phones for the first time. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>As for its cameras, the P10a looks to be using the same sensors as before, including a 48MP main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide and a 13MP selfie shooter in front. That might be a bummer for some, but considering that the Pixel 9a offered by far the best image quality of any phone in its price bracket, I'm not that bothered. Also, it's quite likely that if Google had opted for new hardware, it may have pushed the phone above $500.&nbsp;</p><p>After seeing the positive response to the barely-there camera bump on its predecessor, Google leaned in and made the Pixel 10a’s rear camera module completely flat, and it’s my favorite thing about the phone. There's no hump or protrusions to speak of, and when combined with the rest of the phone's design, it results in a really sleek, minimalist look. Plus, after almost a decade of big and bulky camera warts on the back of phones, it's just nice seeing the Pixel 10a go the opposite direction.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"I really appreciate how Google double downed on feedback regarding the Pixel 9a's tiny camera bump (left) by making the Pixel 10a's camera (right) completely flat. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/pixel-10a-vs-9a-camera.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>I really appreciate how Google double downed on feedback regarding the Pixel 9a's tiny camera bump (left) by making the Pixel 10a's camera (right) completely flat. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>On the flipside, my biggest complaint about the P10a is that Google didn't include Pixelsnap support (aka magnetic Qi2 compatibility). It's another feature that got cut due to cost and it's a real bummer because after introducing it on last year's main Pixel 10 line, I was hoping that it would become a standard inclusion on all Google phones going forward. Thankfully, when I asked about the lack of Pixelsnap support, Google representatives were able to confirm that there will be third-party accessory makers such as Casefinite, Dbrand and Spigen that will offer cases with built-in magnetic rings, so anyone hoping to attach magnetic peripherals will still have an avenue to do so.&nbsp;</p><figure><img alt=\"The Pixel 10a's charging speeds have been improved to 30 watts for wired and 10 watts wirelessly. \" src=\"https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/user-uploaded/pixel-10a-bottom.jpg\" style=\"height: 2000px; width: 3333px;\" /><figcaption>The Pixel 10a's charging speeds have been improved to 30 watts for wired and 10 watts wirelessly. </figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Sam Rutherford for Engadget</div></figure><p>Regardless, for Android phone owners who are in the market for a simple, no-nonsense upgrade that covers all the basics without breaking the bank, the Pixel 10a is looking like another top contender.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pixel 10a is <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=47408a47-7be0-49f0-86aa-563efadfdd37&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=3113f21d-e070-467c-8e52-282518d6b5c3&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Google+Store&amp;linkText=available+for+pre-order&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vbWFnYXppbmUvZ29vZ2xlX3BpeGVsXzEwYT9obD1lbi1VUyIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMzExM2YyMWQtZTA3MC00NjdjLThlNTItMjgyNTE4ZDZiNWMzIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3JlLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vbWFnYXppbmUvZ29vZ2xlX3BpeGVsXzEwYT9obD1lbi1VUyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAWksi-KffAVR2iCOluTPwNjBqp08Lt4ruYl3IOKqdV0S&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.google.com%2Fmagazine%2Fgoogle_pixel_10a%3Fhl%3Den-US\" target=\"_blank\">available for pre-order</a> today in lavender, berry, fog and obsidian with official sales slated for March 5.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/pixel-10a-hands-on-google-locks-down-the-midrange-phone-game-150000513.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Google's $500 Pixel 10a smartphone arrives on March 5",
    "description": "<p>Google debuted the Pixel 10a phone today. Pre-orders are open now and the smartphone will be available starting March 5. Although it's the new 2026 addition to the A series lineup, the Pixel 10a invites many comparisons with last year's <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/google-pixel-9a-review-basic-in-just-the-right-way-130050005.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pixel 9a</a>. For starters, the price is identical at $499.</p>\n<p>Design-wise, not much as changed. The back of the phone can lay flat, which has become a hallmark of the Pixel A collection, rather than wobbling around on a bulky camera housing. The screen is still 6.3 inches with an Actua display. The phone's insides are also the same; the 10a comes with the same Tensor G4 chip and 8GB of RAM as its predecessor, and buyers have the option to upgrade to either 128GB or 256GB of storage. The phone has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and its display uses Corning Gorilla Glass 7i.</p>\n<p>One of the few areas where the 10a is getting a marked upgrade is on its battery. This version claims more than 30 hours of battery life, or up to 120 under the Extra Battery Saver mode. The 10a also brings the welcome addition of proper fast charging, where a compatible charger can get the device to 50 percent battery in about 30 minutes. This addresses one of the few complaints we had about the 9a.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the photo buffs, the Pixel 10a has a 48MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide lens; again unchanged from the specs in the 9a. AI is also present in the new model's photography suite, with the addition of the Camera Coach resource for the first time on the A series lineup. Camera Coach uses Gemini AI models to read the scene and offer tips on getting the desired shot. The 10a also has the Auto Best Take feature for getting everyone's best side in a group shot and the Add Me tool that lets you insert yourself into a photo after the fact.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/googles-500-pixel-10a-smartphone-arrives-on-march-5-150000489.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>Polestar is gearing up to launch <a href=\"https://media.polestar.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/695254/polestar-starts-largest-model-offensive-in-its-history-four-new-cars-in-three-years-5\">three new models</a> in the next two years, including a station wagon (estate or shooting brake) version of the Polestar 4 that harkens back to the company's Volvo roots. The Geely-owned Swedish company sold a record 61,000 EVs in 2025, but hopes that the new models will help it take an even bigger bite out of the market. &quot;We want to get more volume out of a bigger cake,&quot; CEO Michael Lohscheller said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Polestar currently offers two models in the US, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/polestar-3-first-drive-the-long-awaited-suv-is-finally-here-and-its-good-154552543.html\">Polestar 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-4-electric-suv-arrives-with-544-hp-and-no-rear-window-073505710.html\">Polestar 4</a>, both SUVs. However, the new Polestar 4 will come in two variants, one a traditional SUV as before and the other a four-door wagon-type version that combines &quot;the space of an estate and the versatility of an SUV,&quot; Loscheller said. &quot;It's all the good things from the current car, but it's a bit more practical.&quot; This new model is due later this year and will be built in Busan, South Korea in order to avoid US tariffs on cars built in China.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>The automaker is also planning to release a new version of the Polestar 2 targeted at young buyers, though that one is unlikely to come to the US. It will be slightly longer for more passenger space and be produced in China like the current model 2.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Polestar 5, Polestar 4, Polestar 2, Polestar 7\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/767bb730-0cd6-11f1-bb9d-4cb515cb45d6\" style=\"height: 787px; width: 1836px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Polestar</div></figure>\n<p>Finally, the Polestar 7 will be a compact SUV in the same family as Volvo's EX60, set to arrive in Europe to address the fast-growing compact SUV segment. &quot;We are convinced that we can offer customers a progressive performance-driven car for a very attractive price point, built in Europe,&quot; Lohscheller said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new models are designed to help Polestar hit its goal of 60 percent of EV sales worldwide by &quot;targeting the big profit pools of the BEV segment,&quot; Lohscheller stated. Following Polestar's withdrawal from the hyper-competitive Chinese market, Europe accounts for 78 percent of its sales and the US most of the rest — but the company hopes to boost its fortunes in the latter. &quot;People forget that the U.S. is a big EV market, especially on the east and west coasts,&quot; the CEO added. &quot;And it will stay a big market.&quot;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/polestar-unveils-a-station-wagon-version-of-the-4-144025505.html?src=rss",

With the code <strong>MONARCHVIP</strong>, you’ll pay $50 for one year of access instead of the usual $100.</p>\n<p>We’ve recommended Monarch before for its deep customization options and robust financial planning tools. It supports unlimited account connections, investment tracking and shared budgets, making it a solid option if you want a detailed look at your finances or plan alongside a partner. It also features prominently in our roundup of the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html\" target=\"_blank\">best budgeting apps</a>, where it stood out for its depth and flexibility.</p>\n<p>\n </p>\n<p>Monarch Money is the kind of budgeting app that can feel a little overwhelming at first, especially when you’re setting up categories, rules and recurring transactions. There’s a bit of a learning curve, and some of the finer details are easier to manage on the web than in the mobile app. But once you’re past that initial setup, it starts to make a lot more sense and becomes a powerful tool for keeping tabs on your finances.</p>\n<p>Where Monarch Money really shines is in the level of detail it offers. It’s built for people who want a clear, structured view of their money, not just a running list of transactions. In the budgeting section, you can see budgets versus actual spending by category, along with forecasts by month or by year. Recurring expenses can also be defined using more than just merchant names, which helps keep things accurate with less manual cleanup.</p>\n<p>Beyond day-to-day budgeting, Monarch does a good job of showing the bigger picture. It includes visual reports and charts that make it easier to spot trends over time, plus tools for tracking net worth, investments and financial goals. Monarch can even factor in non-cash assets like your home or vehicle, pulling in estimates automatically so they appear alongside your accounts.</p>\n<p>All of that depth won’t be for everyone, but if you’re willing to spend a little time getting set up, <a class=\"link rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=3944d027-cb89-4eee-bf6b-148604c29ff9&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=cdb5dc60-4d5b-4ea6-ab0e-4cd9b4317487&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Monarch+Money&amp;linkText=Monarch+Money&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb25hcmNoLmNvbS8iLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImNkYjVkYzYwLTRkNWItNGVhNi1hYjBlLTRjZDliNDMxNzQ4NyIsIm9yaWdpbmFsVXJsIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubW9uYXJjaC5jb20vIn0&amp;signature=AQAAAUr_Hrzd-ATtIoKDgyQrhn4aUjoS3cxe7UAkFHc9DJ7Q&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.monarch.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Monarch Money</a> offers a lot of control and insight.

    "description": "<p>Tesla has <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/tesla-takes-corrective-action-to-avoid-dmv-suspension/\" target=\"_blank\">stopped using</a> the term “Autopilot” to sell its cars in California, thereby avoiding a 30-day sales and manufacturing ban in the state. If you’ll recall, a California administrative law judge <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-used-deceptive-language-to-market-autopilot-california-judge-rules-035826786.html\" target=\"_blank\">ruled in December</a> that the automaker misled consumers by using the terms “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving.” The judge recommended the suspension, but the California DMV gave Tesla 60 days to remove any untrue and misleading language in its marketing materials. In its announcement, the DMV said Tesla has taken corrective action and has stopped using Autopilot for marketing. Prior to that, the automaker has already clarified that driver supervision is still needed with Full Self-Driving. </p><p>The judge was ruling on a complaint the DMV made back in 2022, wherein the agency accused Tesla of making and disseminating misleading statements. It argued that starting in May 2021, Tesla used deceptive marketing materials with the labels “Autopilot” and  “Full Self-Driving Capability,” as well as claimed that the “system is designed to be able to conduct short and long-distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver’s seat.” In reality, the vehicles equipped with those features “could not at the time of those advertisements, and cannot now, operate as autonomous vehicles,” the DMV said. </p><p>A ban in California could have had a huge effect on the company, seeing as the state <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/teslas-first-quarter-registrations-california-fell-15-industry-data-shows-2025-04-16/\" target=\"_blank\">accounts</a> for nearly a third of its sales in the country. Tesla also recently announced that it will stop the production of its Model S and X cars to turn its Fremont, California factory where they were being manufactured into a space for the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-is-killing-off-its-model-s-and-x-cars-to-make-robots-010621101.html\" target=\"_blank\">production of its Optimus</a> humanoid robots. Tesla has huge plans for Optimus and intends to start selling the robot to the public by the end of 2027. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/tesla-stops-using-autopilot-to-promote-its-evs-in-california-112533060.html?src=rss",

As part of that, the social media giant will deploy NVIDIA's <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-confidential-computing/\">Confidential Computing</a> for WhatsApp, &quot;enabling AI-powered capabilities across the messaging platform while ensuring user data confidentiality and integrity.&quot;</p>\n<p>As part of the deal, Meta committed to using NVIDIA's Confidential Computing for WhatsApp messaging to allow AI inside the app while guaranteeing user data confidentiality. That technology will let Meta secure data during computation, not just when it's being shuttled to a server. It also allows software creators like Meta or third-party AI agent providers &quot;to preserve their intellectual property,&quot; NVIDIA wrote on a <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-confidential-computing/\">blog</a> about the technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Meta will also be the first to deploy NVIDIA's Grace CPUs in a standalone way, instead of incorporating them with GPUs. They're designed to run inference and agentic workloads when running in this fashion. Meta will also be using NVIDIA's Spectrum-X Ethernet switches.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meta announced earlier this year that it would spend up to $135 billion on AI in 2026, so it's not a surprise that a big chunk of that is going toward NVIDIA.

    "title": "The best drone for 2026",
    "description": "<p>Drones are no longer just niche toys for enthusiasts. Today’s models are compact, increasingly affordable and capable of capturing sharp aerial photos and video with minimal effort. Whether you’re curious about flying for the first time or looking to upgrade to a more advanced camera drone, the options available in 2026 are broader and more approachable than ever.<br /><br />Entry-level drones now offer features like GPS-assisted flight, return-to-home safety systems and automated shooting modes that take much of the stress out of learning to fly. Step up to more advanced models and you’ll find foldable designs that travel easily, longer flight times and stabilized 4K video that holds up well beyond social media clips.<br /><br />We’ve tested a range of drones to identify the best options across different skill levels and budgets. Whether your priority is learning the basics, capturing polished aerial footage or packing light for travel, these picks highlight the drones that offer the best balance of performance, reliability and ease of use.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-drones-for-2026\">Best drones for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-what-to-look-for-in-a-drone\">What to look for in a drone</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-camera-features\">Camera features</h3> \n<p>For this guide, we're looking only at drones that are basically flying cameras, so you want the best video and photo features possible. Bigger devices like DJI’s Mavic 3 Pro or Air 3S carry relatively large sensors, offering superior camera quality for nighttime cityscapes or other low-light scenes. Smaller models like the Mini 4 Pro and HoverAir X1 Max use smaller camera sensors, so they aren’t as good in dim light.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>Field of view and minimum aperture are also important, with most drones typically having a wide-angle focal length, though a few others like the HoverAir X1 Max carry an ultrawide lens. Some models have multiple cameras including a wide and a zoom. As for aperture, lower numbers are better and allow for shooting in dim light. Most DJI models are solid in this regard, while the HoverAir models don’t perform as well.</p> \n<p>Video resolution and slow-mo are also essential camera capabilities. Most drones these days can shoot at 4K with a frame rate of at least 30 fps, though some offer 6K or even 8K at up to 30 fps. Higher-end models can shoot 4K at up to 120 fps, allowing you to slow down the action dramatically to create a cinematic look.</p> \n<p>Other noteworthy features include log or HDR video that supports higher dynamic range, particularly in bright and sunny conditions. Finally, the camera’s gimbal and stabilization are important factors to keep your footage looking as smooth as possible. Some drones have gimbals that can rotate the camera 90 degrees to give social media creators the maximum resolution for vertical formats.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-drone-features-speed-range-safety-battery-life-and-obstacle-detection\">Drone features: Speed, range, safety, battery life and obstacle detection</h3> \n<p>By and large, there are two types of camera drones to consider. The first are standard drones (usually with open propellers but not always) designed to fly outside and take scenic shots. Often there’s nothing to stop the props from striking skin or objects, so they can’t really be used indoors or around people. Some models like the DJI Neo and Flip have prop guards that better protect bystanders and property, as well as the drone itself.</p> \n<p>Then there's first-person-view (FPV) camera drones, which often have propeller guards and are meant to be used both indoors or outside to capture exciting footage. Standard models don’t need to go particularly fast as they’re mainly used to shoot fun videos for social media, but FPV drones need to move at high speeds to create excitement. Because of that speed, they’re also better in breezy conditions thanks to stronger wind resistance, and they can fight gusts and return home more quickly. Acrobatic abilities (often promoted by the manufacturer in ads or packaging) are also important for FPV drones, as it allows the user to perform tricks and zip around obstacles.</p> \n<p>Battery life is another important factor. The best drones boast a battery endurance of up to 45 minutes, while FPV drones like the Avata 2 can only fly for about half that time as they tend to be heavier and carry smaller batteries to reduce weight. As a general rule, a single battery isn’t enough for any serious shooting so you’d do well to buy your drone in a kit with a few batteries and a charger.</p> \n<p>As for range, DJI tends to dominate in this area, with its latest models able to maintain a video signal at a distance up to 20km (12.4 miles). HoverAir’s models are weaker with the top-end X1 Max model limited to just 1km (0.6 miles) when using the optional beacon system. DJI also offers multiple ways to control its drones including headsets, joystick-type controllers, motion detection controllers and smartphones.</p> \n<p>The best drones have sensors to detect obstacles in all directions. Others are limited to only avoiding obstructions coming at them from the front and some only rely on the main camera to prevent crashes. Finally, if you want to have your drone follow you around automatically, you’ll need it to be able to track you around when you’re vlogging, riding a bike or skiing, while also avoiding obstacles. Smooth takeoff and return-to-home features are especially valuable here for both beginners and experienced drone pilots as well.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-drone-faqs\">Best drone FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-are-the-rules-for-owning-a-drone\">What are the rules for owning a drone?</h3> \n<p>Anyone can buy any drone, but once purchased, all drones between 250g and 25 kg must be registered with the FAA and marked with the FAA registration number. Recreational pilots with drones over 249g must pass the recreational UAS safety &quot;TRUST&quot; exam and carry proof of TRUST completion when flying a drone. Commercial pilots must obtain a Remote Pilot Certificate from the FAA. You must be aware of and avoid any areas with airspace restrictions, particularly around airports.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-are-drones-safe-to-fly-in-the-city\">Are drones safe to fly in the city?</h3> \n<p>In general, it is not legal to fly a drone within city limits over populations, as a crash from a high altitude could injure or kill someone. However, they can be flown over adjacent, non-populated areas in many cases. Here is a guide to where: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://uavcoach.com/where-to-fly-drone/__;!!Op6eflyXZCqGR5I!HQuPK2xnNADZaZ-orh1MAw0sDtzwAQev2rmEBSfYjWnKaV-lRiQJQ3dcGhn6XO62yP3fkn_IkIbshG9auvRYrGvW-BSa$\">https://uavcoach.com/where-to-fly-drone/</a></p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-the-average-flight-time-of-a-drone\">What is the average flight time of a drone?</h3> \n<p>Most drones can fly for around 20-30 minutes, though some advanced models like DJI's Mavic 4 can fly up to 40 minutes or more.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cameras/best-drone-120046775.html?src=rss",

Ahead of the event, Samsung teased some of what's to come for AI in terms of the Galaxy S26 smartphone lineup's photography tools.&nbsp;</p><p>The S26 phones will feature a new camera system using Galaxy AI that combines capturing, editing and sharing of photos and videos. &quot;Users will be able to turn a photo from day to night in seconds, restore missing parts of objects in images, capture detailed photos in low light, and seamlessly merge multiple photos into a single, cohesive result,&quot; a company rep said. The video clips Samsung shared demonstrated the before and after results of using its AI tools, which will all be housed in a single app rather than needing to switch between multiple image editing programs.</p><p>Updated cameras are just part of what will be on the schedule for Samsung's big mobile showcase. The expected Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ and Galaxy S26 Ultra will likely have a lot of AI-centric features.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-teases-mobile-ai-photography-tools-ahead-of-unpacked-233000358.html?src=rss",

This is the hot new trend in air travel: pulling out all the stops to cater to the wealthy.</p>\n\t<p>Airlines are adding suites with more bed space, privacy doors, an extra ottoman for guests. They&#8217;re offering caviar, free PJs, luxury skin care products, and multi-course meals with wine pairings made by gourmet chefs. They&#8217;re also building more airport lounges. Meanwhile, economy is getting more cramped and low-cost carriers are going bankrupt. It&#8217;s because wealthy passengers are where the money&#8217;s at.</p>\n\t<p>For years, airlines have made more money from their credit cards than from actually flying passengers around. And these days, premium seating is bringing in more revenue than the economy cabin. It&#8217;s a perfect example of the K-shaped economy.</p></blockquote>\n\t<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/kshaped-economy-spending-income-inequality-dfa59144ecb2e1b674242666e28ff556\">an AP article about the K-shaped economy</a> from late last year.</p>\n\t<blockquote><p>Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers.</p></blockquote>\n \n\n        \n         <p><strong>Tags:</strong> <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/business\">business</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/economics\">economics</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/USA\">USA</a> · <a href=\"https://kottke.org/tag/video\">video</a></p>",

    "description": "<p>Texas is suing Wi-Fi router maker TP-Link for deceptively marketing the security of its products and allowing Chinese hacking groups to access Americans' devices, Attorney General Ken Paxton <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-paxton-sues-tp-link-allowing-ccp-access-americans-devices-first-several-lawsuits\" target=\"_blank\">has announced</a>.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott later prohibited state employees <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-updates-texas-prohibited-technologies-list\" target=\"_blank\">from using TP-Link products</a> in January of this year. </p><p>TP-Link is no longer owned by a Chinese company and its products are assembled in Vietnam, but <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/press/TP%20P.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Paxton's lawsuit</a> claims that because the company's &quot;ownership and supply-chain are tied to China&quot; it's subject to the country's data laws, which require companies to comply with requests from Chinese intelligence agencies. The lawsuit also says that firmware vulnerabilities in TP-Link's hardware have already &quot;exposed millions of consumers to severe cybersecurity risks.&quot;</p><p>TP-Link provided the following statement to Engadget in response to the lawsuit: </p><blockquote><p>The claims made by the Texas Attorney General’s office are without merit and will be proven false. TP-Link Systems Inc. is an independent American company. Neither the Chinese government nor the CCP exercises any form of ownership or control over TP-Link, its products, or its user data. TP-Link’s founder and CEO, Jeffrey Chao, resides in Irvine, CA, and is not and never has been a member of the CCP. To ensure the highest level of security, our core operations and infrastructure are located entirely within the United States, and all U.S. users' networking data is stored securely on Amazon Web Services servers. We will continue to vigorously defend our reputation as a trusted provider of secure connectivity for American families.</p></blockquote><p>TP-Link was <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/tp-link-routers-are-being-investigated-by-several-us-authorities-151552304.html\" target=\"_blank\">reportedly being investigated</a> at the federal level in 2024 after its devices were connected to the massive <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/new-report-details-vast-spying-by-china-linked-telecom-hackers-010347224.html\" target=\"_blank\">&quot;Salt Typhoon&quot; hack</a> that accessed data from multiple US telecom companies.

Expect a lot of news about Google’s AI efforts as well, such as what’s next for Gemini.</p><div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 773px;\"><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">See you all at Google I/O starting May 19th! <a href=\"https://t.co/KgNKbb3nMu\">https://t.co/KgNKbb3nMu</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/OD6x3IYtTi\">pic.twitter.com/OD6x3IYtTi</a></p>— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/2023847540400288134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote>\n\n\n</div><p>As has been the case for <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-25-google-io-2019-may-7th.html\" target=\"_blank\">several years</a>, Google revealed the conference’s dates for 2026 after enough folks <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://io.google/2026/puzzle/\" target=\"_blank\">completed a puzzle</a> on the I/O website. This year’s puzzle has multiple “builds” to play through, all of which use Gemini. </p><p>They start with a mini-golf game in which a virtual caddy that’s powered by Gemini offers some of the most anodyne advice imaginable. The second build is a nonogram. If you’ve ever played a Picross game, you’ll know what to do here. It’s about using logic to place tiles on a grid in order to create an image. Here, Google is using Gemini to generate “endless game boards.”</p><p>The other three minigames are Word Wheel (which “leverages Gemini 3 to automate level design”), Super Sonicbot (which “uses Gemini to introduce microphone mechanics where noise controls the Android Bot’s altitude”) and Stretchy Cat. The latter “uses Gemini 3 as a stage designer balancing game mechanics and difficulty to create endless play.”</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/general/google-io-2026-is-set-for-may-19-and-20-200805024.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Netflix is adapting the board game Ticket to Ride",
    "description": "<p>Netflix has been in the game adaptation business for a while now, but until recently most of its attention had been on adapting <em>video </em>games. That’s still very much <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-show-could-kick-off-in-ancient-rome-200238552.html\">happening</a>, but the streaming giant is also now buying up rights for board game IP too, with the latest being Asmodee’s <em>Ticket to Ride</em>.</p>\n<p>Netflix will look to greenlight a number of projects spanning TV, film and &quot;additional formats,&quot; it wrote in a press release. The first of these will be a feature film written by Ben Mekler and Chris Amick. <em>Ticket to Ride </em>creator Alan R. Moon will serve as an executive producer on the project, which will be the game’s first on-screen adaptation. Exactly what it will look like is not yet clear, but the internet already has <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/1r78sau/netflix_developing_ticket_to_ride_movie/\"><ins>plenty</ins></a> of theories.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p><em>Ticket to Ride</em> is a train-themed turn-based strategy and route-building game first released over 20 years ago. Since then it has gone on to ship more than 20 million copies and has been translated into over 30 languages. It’s also been given the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-12-ticket-to-ride-tabletop-ps4-playlink-mobile.html\"><ins>video game</ins></a> adaptation treatment before.</p>\n<p>This is actually the second of Asmodee’s IP that Netflix has acquired the rights to, after announcing last year that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/netflix-is-adapting-catan-into-movies-and-tv-shows-185133712.html\"><em><ins>Catan</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>will also be making its way to screens in various forms. And it isn’t just interested in scripted TV and movie opportunities. In early 2025, the company also signed a deal with Hasbro to adapt <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/04/monopoly-reality-competition-series-netflix-1236362416/\"><em><ins>Monopoly</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>into a TV game show.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/netflix-is-adapting-the-board-game-ticket-to-ride-180505164.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>ExpressVPN is <a href=\"https://checkout.expressvpn.com/order\">back on sale</a> again, and its two-year plans are up to 81 percent off right now. You can get the Advanced tier for $88 for 28 months. This is marked down from the $392 that this time frame normally costs. On a per-month basis, it works out to roughly $3.14 for the promo period.</p> \n<p>We’ve consistently liked ExpressVPN because it’s fast, easy to use and widely available across a large global server network. In fact, it's our current pick for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html\">best premium VPN</a>. One of the biggest drawbacks has always been its high cost, and this deal temporarily solves that issue.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/expressvpn-review-2025-fast-speeds-and-a-low-learning-curve-160052884.html\">review</a> we were able to get fast download and upload speeds, losing only 7 percent in the former and 2 percent in the latter worldwide. We found that it could unblock Netflix anywhere, and its mobile and desktop apps were simple to operate. We gave ExpressVPN an overall score of 85 out of 100.</p> \n<p>The virtual private network service now has three tiers. Basic is cheaper with fewer features, while Pro costs more and adds extra perks like support for 14 simultaneous devices and a password manager. Advanced sits in the middle and includes the password manager but only supports 12 devices.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/save-up-to-81-percent-on-expressvpn-two-year-plans-right-now-180602273.html?src=rss",

Of Davis, Gillespie said: &#8220;O-o-oh, honey, you know his schtick. He&#8217;s ready for that position.

Meta-owned Instagram and Facebook currently <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/meta-announces-paid-subscriptions-for-both-instagram-and-facebook-in-the-uk-140913304.html\">offer a similar feature</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/social-media/snapchat-gives-parents-more-info-on-who-their-kids-are-talking-to-120000077.html\">Snapchat</a>, creator subscriptions will give users access to exclusive content across Snaps and Stories. They will also get priority replies and go ad-free on stories. Snapchat pitches the new feature as great way to give creators &quot;freedom to experiment&quot; and &quot;build a recurring income stream&quot; — all good things for keeping people on your platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Creators can choose exactly how much they want to charge subscribers per month. They can spread these figures out across Snapchat's recommended tiers.&nbsp;</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Snapchat creator subscriptions.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-02/2c68e5a0-0c13-11f1-bff8-7c48ace275c1\" style=\"height: 1000px; width: 562px;\" /><figcaption></figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Snap</div></figure>\n<p>Starting February 23, select US-based Snapchat creators will be able to offer subscriptions.

    "description": "<p>Despite its supremely sleek design, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/the-iphone-air-is-a-great-advertisement-for-the-iphone-17-201318112.html\">iPhone Air</a> actually has a pretty respectable battery life, lasting for somewhere in the region of 27 hours if you’re continuously streaming video. But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day. That’s where Apple’s <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0FQFH9BST&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=b81fb587-99ff-4a0a-8491-b9b9460d3e9a&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=iPhone+Air+MagSafe&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1Q_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiYjgxZmI1ODctOTlmZi00YTBhLTg0OTEtYjliOTQ2MGQzZTlhIiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL2RwL0IwRlFGSDlCU1QiLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAR9o3Bk1eGEoY_MpvpdVaX8WwrXHv-kJY6NrXwaRfhTy&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0FQFH9BST\">iPhone Air MagSafe</a> battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/airpods-pro-3-review-a-significant-update-to-apples-best-earbuds-120028170.html\">AirPods Pro 3</a> as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an &quot;essential accessory&quot; for some users in his <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-review-thinness-with-purpose-120037520.html\">iPhone Air</a> review.</p> \n<p>Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup.

It's not the first time <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-extended-battery-airtag-case-is-down-to-only-16-162308748.html\">we've seen this deal</a>, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>This is arguably one of the more useful <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag accessories</a> around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.</p> \n<p>Elevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.</p> \n<p>There are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.</p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals\"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on X for the latest </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/\"><em>tech deals</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-tech/\"><em>buying advice</em></a><em>.</em></p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-airtag-10-year-extended-battery-case-is-only-16-right-now-151215061.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<p>At this point, you can find discounts on AirTags fairly often but if you want to spend as little as possible, it's worth waiting for a discount like this. A four-pack of the first-gen Bluetooth trackers is on sale for $64, which is just about a record-low price (only $1 more). That's a 35 percent discount on the pack.</p> \n<p>Bear in mind that this deal brings the price per <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html\">AirTag</a> down to about $16 if you were to buy them individually, and when not on sale they usually cost $29.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>\n </p> \n<p>If you use Apple devices and consider yourself to be a serial thing-misplacer, AirTags are extremely useful. Adding one to your account takes a single tap, and with Apple’s Find My network so well established, locating missing items has never been easier.</p> \n<p>Using your iPhone you can trigger a sound from the AirTag’s built-in speaker, or alternatively Precision Finding can be used to pinpoint its location via Find My. You just follow the instructions on your iPhone, paying attention to the vibrations that signal you’re getting closer.</p> \n<p>A reminder again that the above deals apply to the first-generation AirTag only. Apple introduced a refreshed <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/apple-airtag-2026-review-143000427.html\">tracker</a> with greater range and a louder speaker last month, which <a class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" href=\"https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;itemId=amazon_B0GJTFXNRX&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;contentUuid=2e745850-e368-4111-83ab-157ddbe84ac4&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;linkText=retail&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8_dGFnPWdkZ3QwYy0yMCIsImNvbnRlbnRVdWlkIjoiMmU3NDU4NTAtZTM2OC00MTExLTgzYWItMTU3ZGRiZTg0YWM0Iiwib3JpZ2luYWxVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0FwcGxlLUFpclRhZy0ybmQtR2VuZXJhdGlvbi1QcmVjaXNpb24vZHAvQjBHSlRGWE5SWC8iLCJkeW5hbWljQ2VudHJhbFRyYWNraW5nSWQiOnRydWUsInNpdGVJZCI6InVzLWVuZ2FkZ2V0IiwicGFnZUlkIjoiMXAtYXV0b2xpbmsiLCJmZWF0dXJlSWQiOiJ0ZXh0LWxpbmsifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAaPN9LXQY-0xtODu-zAc_6biP338yFAO58xyoY7PRH7K&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-AirTag-2nd-Generation-Precision%2Fdp%2FB0GJTFXNRX%2F\">retail</a>s at the same price as its predecessor.

EC officials are concerned about the sale of illegal products, including <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cddrg70pj1mo\"><ins>child sexual abuse material</ins></a>, as well as the potentially addictive design of its shopping experience. The Commission found fellow low-cost retailer Temu <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1913\"><ins>in violation</ins></a> of the Digital Services Act after a similar investigation last year.</p>\n<p>The probe is being opened under the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act\"><ins>Digital Services Act</ins></a>, a set of EU rules governing online services. The Commission will examine how Shein drives engagement with shoppers, including using a points and rewards system, and whether the company is properly mitigating the risk of addiction via these and other features.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Algorithmic recommendation systems are another point of contention, and the Commission will ask Shein to disclose how it suggests  products to users.

    "title": "EU launches second investigation into Grok's nonconsensual image generation",
    "description": "<p>X is facing yet another investigation into Grok's reported creation of nonconsensual sexual images on the platform. Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has announced an <a href=\"https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-opens-investigation-x-xiuc\">inquiry into X</a> regarding the harmful, intimate images and processing of EU and EEA individuals' personal data — including children.</p>\n<p>In an 11-day period, X generated about <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-generated-an-estimated-3-million-sexualized-images--including-23000-of-children--over-11-days-175053250.html\">three million sexualized images</a>, an estimated 23,000 of which were of children. British nonprofit, the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) announced the <a href=\"https://counterhate.com/research/grok-floods-x-with-sexualized-images/\">results</a> of its December 29 to January 9 review last month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Critically, the investigation will determine whether X has broken GDPR laws. &quot;The DPC has been engaging with XIUC since media reports first emerged a number of weeks ago concerning the alleged ability of X users to prompt the @Grok account on X to generate sexualised images of real people, including children,&quot; DPC deputy commissioner Graham Doyle said, referring to X using the full title X Internet Unlimited Company (XIUC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Doyle continued: &quot;As the Lead Supervisory Authority for XIUC across the EU/EEA, the DPC has commenced a large-scale inquiry which will examine XIUC’s compliance with some of their fundamental obligations under the GDPR in relation to the matters at hand.&quot;</p>\n<p>The DPC's probe could have repercussions for X across the EU, while also building on similar probes in the bloc. In January, the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-eu-is-investigating-grok-and-x-over-potentially-illegal-deepfakes-134506678.html\">launched an investigation</a> into whether X has violated the Digital Services Act. It's looking into if X has properly &quot;assessed and mitigated&quot; Grok's risks on X, including the spread of illegal content such as the AI-generation nonconsensual sexually explicit images. Once again this includes those of children — this disturbing point can't be emphasized too much.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>X claimed in mid-January that it was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/x-says-grok-will-no-longer-edit-images-of-real-people-into-bikinis-231430257.html\">preventing Grok</a> from editing photos of real people to give them revealing clothing. However, this seems far from the truth. Earlier this month, a male reporter found Grok would still put him <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/grok-which-maybe-stopped-undressing-women-without-their-consent-still-undresses-men-170750752.html\">in revealing clothing</a> and even added visible genitalia.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-launches-second-investigation-into-groks-nonconsensual-image-generation-113239967.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best noise-canceling headphones for 2026",
    "description": "<p>Noise is hard to escape, whether it’s the hum of traffic, the buzz of a busy office or the neighbor’s lawn mower starting up right when you need to focus. That’s where noise-canceling headphones earn their keep. A good pair doesn’t just quiet the world around you, it creates a pocket of calm so you can actually enjoy your music, podcasts or peace and quiet.<br /><br />Modern noise-canceling headphones have come a long way, combining powerful ANC with clearer sound, longer battery life and smarter features like adaptive modes and multipoint connectivity. Some emphasize comfort for long flights, while others are tuned for audiophiles who want studio-level clarity.<br /><br />We’ve tested a wide range of options to find the best noise-canceling headphones for every listener. Whether you’re after something lightweight for travel or a premium set for focused work sessions, these picks deliver the sound, silence and comfort you need to tune out the chaos.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-noise-canceling-headphones-of-2026\">Best noise-canceling headphones of 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-\"></h2> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-noise-canceling-headphones-for-you\">How to choose the best noise-canceling headphones for you</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>When you’re shopping for the best wireless headphones, the first thing you’ll need to decide on is wear style. Do you prefer on-ear or over-ear headphones? For the purposes of this guide, I focus on the over-ear style as that’s what most noise-canceling headphones are nowadays. Sure, you can find on-ear models with ANC, but over-ear, active noise-canceling headphones are much more effective at blocking outside sounds since your ears are completely covered.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>For gamers, there are also <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-headset-130006477.html\">gaming headsets</a> that feature noise cancellation — some even have detachable microphones, so they can double as over-ear headphones. However, for the purpose of this article, we’re only going to be focusing on noise-canceling headphones rather than headsets. Look for models with a comfortable headband and memory foam ear cups to ensure you can wear them for long periods without discomfort.</p> \n<p>Many headphones also come with a range of color options, so if aesthetics matter to you, you’ll find plenty of choices beyond just black or white. Whether you’re looking for something neutral or a bold pop of color, brands now offer a variety of styles to match your personal taste.</p> \n<p>Finally, if you’re planning to wear your headphones for long periods of time, it’s important to pick a model with a comfortable fit. Memory foam ear cups, an adjustable headband, and lightweight materials can make all the difference during extended listening sessions. After all, great sound is only part of the equation; comfort matters just as much.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of headphones offers. You’ll come across terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>on the outside of the device to detect outside noise and cancel it out. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it does so at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups. Adaptive noise-canceling also does a better job with wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using headphones outdoors. Some high-end headphones also support Dolby Atmos, which enhances spatial audio and makes everything from music to movies sound more immersive. For the purposes of this best headphones list, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise and improving your overall listening experience.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of headphones offers adjustable levels of noise cancellation or presets. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help you save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that provide both maximum noise blocking and more efficient cancellation that is more energy efficient. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level to your liking. Some high-end models even allow you to fine-tune the ANC for specific types of environments.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-headphones\">How we test noise-canceling headphones</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test headphones is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the headphones to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for headphones can be 30 hours or more, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). Due to the longer battery estimates, I’ll typically power the headphones off several times and leave them that way during a review. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to constantly monitor the process for over 24 straight hours.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use headphones in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I use them during air travel since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I can’t hop on a flight, I’ll simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well each device blocks human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC headphones.</p> \n<p>ANC-related features are something else to consider. Here, I do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double checked for improvements or regression. If the headphones I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set. Ditto for the closest competition for each new set of headphones that I review.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-other-noise-canceling-headphones-we-tested\">Other noise-canceling headphones we tested</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-airpods-max\">AirPods Max</h3> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326-143034684.html\">Apple’s AirPods Max</a> are premium, well-designed over-ear headphones that incorporate all of the best features you find on standard AirPods: solid noise cancellation, spatial audio and easy Siri access. However, their $550 starting price makes them almost prohibitively expensive, even for Apple users. There are better options available at lower prices, but if you can pick up the AirPods Max at a steep discount, they might be worthwhile for the biggest Apple fans among us.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-dyson-on-trac\">Dyson On-Trac</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/dyson-ontrac-headphones-review-when-the-basics-arent-enough-151518312.html\">On-Trac headphones</a> have an almost infinitely customizable design, and that’s what’s most unique about them. The sound profile offers some nice detail, but lacks dynamic range overall. ANC is average at best and there aren’t any advanced features that will make your life easier. Well, except for the hearing health monitor, which is actually handy. All told, that’s not a lot for a set of $500 headphones.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sonos-ace\">Sonos Ace</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sonos-ace-headphones-review-an-impressive-but-incomplete-debut-130040041.html\">Sonos Ace</a> is an excellent debut for the company’s first headphones. The combination of refined design, great sound quality and home theater tricks creates a unique formula. However, ANC performance is just okay and key functionality is still in the works for many users.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sony-ult-wear\">Sony ULT Wear</h3> \n<p>If most headphones don’t have the level of bass you desire, the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sony-ult-wear-headphones-review-brain-shaking-bass-160000739.html\">ULT Wear</a> is an option to consider. The low-end thump isn’t for everyone, but there are also plenty of handy features and a refined look to make the $200 set more compelling than many in this price range.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-beats-studio-pro\">Beats Studio Pro</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-pro-review-upgraded-sound-makes-all-the-difference-140058369.html\">Studio Pro</a> lacks basic features like automatic pausing, and multipoint connectivity is only available on Android. Moreover, they’re not very comfortable for people with larger heads. Overall sound quality is improved, though, and voice performance on calls is well above average.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-master--dynamic-mh40-2nd-gen\">Master &amp; Dynamic MH40 (2nd gen)</h3> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-2nd-gen-review-133022239.html\">MH40</a> are a great set of headphones if you favor crisp, clear and natural sound that isn’t overly tuned. This pair showcases the company’s affinity for leather and metal too, but limited customization and short battery life for non-ANC cans kept this set from making the cut.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-bowers--wilkins-px8\">Bowers &amp; Wilkins Px8</h3> \n<p>The company’s trademark pristine sound is on display here, but the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/bowers-and-wilkins-px8-review-183002357.html\">Px8</a> is more expensive and not nearly as comfortable as the Px7 S3.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-noble-audio-fokus-apollo\">Noble Audio FoKus Apollo</h3> \n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/noble-audio-fokus-apollo-review-the-high-price-of-pristine-audio-141521043.html\">this</a> is my top pick for overall sound quality in our main guide to the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-headphones-wireless-bluetooth-120543205.html\">best wireless headphones</a>, the ANC performance is less impressive than the Px7 S3. Bowers &amp; Wilkins gets the nod here for its improved noise cancellation over the Px7 S2 and Px7 S2e, and its overall excellent audio quality.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-noise-canceling-headphones-faqs\">Noise-canceling headphones FAQs</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-block-all-noise\">Does noise cancellation block all noise?</h3> \n<p>Noise cancellation doesn’t block out all noise, though it does drastically reduce the volume of most external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-there-a-difference-between-wired-vs-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones\">Is there a difference between wired vs wireless noise-canceling headphones?</h3> \n<p>In terms of sound quality, if you have two headphones — one wired and one wireless — with similar specs, the difference is going to be very minimal. However, wireless headphones offer more convenience, allowing you to move around more freely with your headphones on, which is why they often feature noise cancellation to minimize external sounds.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-does-noise-cancellation-impact-sound-quality\">Does noise cancellation impact sound quality?</h3> \n<p>ANC does bear some weight on sound quality, but the impact of this often doesn’t outweigh the benefits. Noise cancellation reduces ambient noise, allowing a greater focus on audio detail. For audiophiles, however, there may be a small difference in sound fidelity when ANC is turned on.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-headphones-130029881.html?src=rss",

This allows the mics to pair with iPhones and iPads via Bluetooth without the need for a receiver. All you’ll need is the Rode Capture app. </p><p>Rode said it’s able to offer Direct Connect for Wireless Pro and Wireless Go without compromising “the broadcast-quality audio both wireless systems are known for.” The feature still supports the option to record from two transmitters in either merged (whereby the audio blends into a single stereo track) or split (which keeps the recordings on separate channels to allow for more options in post-production) modes.</p><p>Not having to worry about setting up a physical receiver to link these mics to iOS devices could help streamline things quite a bit for creators. And I can always get behind companies adding handy features to existing products without pushing customers to buy new models. That’s good for the environment, your wallet — assuming you already have one of these mics — and probably the company’s reputation. An all-around positive update. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/more-rode-mics-can-now-connect-directly-to-iphones-and-ipads-230000533.html?src=rss",

    "title": "The best noise-canceling earbuds for 2026",
    "description": "<p>Noise-canceling earbuds have become an everyday essential for a lot of people, whether you’re trying to survive a noisy commute, concentrate in a shared workspace or just carve out a little quiet time. Advances in active noise cancellation and audio processing mean today’s best earbuds do a much better job of cutting through background noise, without forcing you to move up to bulky over-ear headphones.<br /><br />The latest models also balance sound quality with convenience, offering stable Bluetooth connections, comfortable fits and battery life that can last through a full day with help from their charging cases. From premium options with the strongest ANC to more affordable picks that still get the basics right, there’s no shortage of solid choices depending on what you value most.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-best-noise-cancelling-earbuds-for-2026\">Best noise-cancelling earbuds for 2026</h2> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<p>\n </p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-choose-the-best-noise-canceling-earbuds-for-you\">How to choose the best noise-canceling earbuds for you</h2> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-design\">Design</h3> \n<p>Most true wireless earbuds these days have a “traditional” design that’s a round bud that fits in your ear canals. However, there are some variations on the formula in terms of shape, size and additional fitting elements. Some companies include fins or fit wings to help hold their in-ear earbuds in place while others opt for an over-the-ear hook on more <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-for-running-120044637.html\">sporty models</a>. You’ll want to pay attention to these things to make sure they align with how you plan to use them. Also consider overall size and weight since those two factors can impact the fit. A less-than-ideal seal due to a weird fit will affect the performance of active noise-canceling earbuds.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-type-of-noise-cancellation\">Type of noise cancellation</h3> \n<p>Next, you’ll want to look at the type of ANC a set of earbuds offer. You’ll see terms like “hybrid active noise cancellation” or “hybrid adaptive active noise cancellation,” and there are key differences between the two. A hybrid ANC setup uses microphones on the inside <em>and </em>the outside of the device to detect ambient noise. By analyzing input from both mics, a hybrid system can combat more sounds than “regular” ANC, but it’s at a constant level that doesn’t change.</p> \n<p>Adaptive ANC takes the hybrid configuration a step further by continuously adjusting the noise cancellation for changes in your environment and any leakage around the padding of the ear cups or ear tips. Adaptive ANC is also better at combating wind noise, which can really kill your vibe while using earbuds outdoors. For this top pick list of the best noise-canceling earbuds, I’m only considering products with hybrid ANC or adaptive ANC setups because those are the most effective at blocking noise in noisy environments.</p> \n<h3 id=\"jump-link-customization\">Customization</h3> \n<p>You’ll also want to check to see if the ANC system on a prospective set of earbuds offers presets or adjustable levels of noise reduction. These can help you dial in the amount of ANC you need for various environments, but it can also help save battery life. Master &amp; Dynamic, for example, has ANC presets that either provide maximum noise-blocking or prioritize energy efficiency. Other companies may include a slider in their companion apps that let you adjust the ANC level.</p> \n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-we-test-noise-canceling-earbuds\">How we test noise-canceling earbuds</h2> \n<p>The primary way we test earbuds is to wear them as much as possible. I prefer to do this over a one-to-two-week period, but sometimes deadlines don’t allow it. During this time, I listen to a mix of music and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/podcasts/\">podcasts</a>, while also using the earbuds to take both voice and video calls.</p> \n<p>Since battery life for ANC earbuds is typically 6-10 hours, I drain the battery with looping music and the volume set at a comfortable level (usually around 75 percent). When necessary, I’ll power the headphones off during a review without putting them back in the case. This simulates real-world use and keeps me from having to wear them for an entire day.</p> \n<p>To test ANC performance specifically, I use the earbuds in a variety of environments, from noisy coffee shops to quiet home offices. When my schedule allows, I also use them during air travel, since plane noise is a massive distraction to both work and relaxation. Even if I’m not slated to hop on a flight, I simulate a constant roar with white noise machines, bathroom fans, vacuums and more. I also make note of how well earbuds block human voices, which are a key stumbling block for a lot of ANC setups.</p> \n<p>I also do a thorough review of companion apps, testing each feature as I work through the software. Any holdovers from previous models are double-checked for improvements or regression. If the earbuds I’m testing are an updated version of a previous model, I’ll spend time getting reacquainted with the older set, and revisit the closest competition as well.</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/best-noise-canceling-earbuds-150026857.html?src=rss",

    "title": "iPhone Fold rumors: Everything we know so far, including the leaked design, upgrades, price and more details",
    "description": "<p>Apple still hasn’t officially announced a foldable iPhone, but the rumor mill hasn’t slowed down. Over the past few months, analysts, supply-chain watchers and leakers have continued to sketch out what Apple’s first folding phone might look like and when it could finally arrive. Most signs still point to a late-2026 debut, though plenty could change between now and then.</p><p>As always with unreleased Apple hardware, nothing here is confirmed. Plans can shift, features can be reworked and timelines can slip. Still, the volume and consistency of recent reporting gives us a better sense than ever of how the so-called iPhone Fold could take shape.</p><p>Below, we’ve rounded up the most credible rumors so far, and we’ll keep this guide updated as new details emerge.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-when-could-the-iphone-fold-launch\">When could the iPhone Fold launch?</h2><p>Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://theorg.com/org/bloomberg/org-chart/mark-gurman\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Gurman</a> has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-11/apple-2027-plans-tabletop-robot-20th-anniversary-iphone-ios-19-wi-fi-feature\" target=\"_blank\">ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027</a>. Analyst <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\" target=\"_blank\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.</p><p>Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-what-will-the-iphone-fold-look-like\">What will the iPhone Fold look like?</h2><p>Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/apple-is-already-thinking-about-its-second-foldable-iphone-and-it-may-be-a-clamshell-202312700.html\" target=\"_blank\">clamshell flip phone</a>.</p><p>When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3030017/a-case-maker-might-have-leaked-the-iphone-fold-design.html\" target=\"_blank\">CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds</a> suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the<a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-air-hands-on-the-super-sleek-precursor-to-apples-upcoming-foldable-185851102.html\" target=\"_blank\"> iPhone Air as a potential preview</a> of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.</p><p>If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.</p><figure><img alt=\"iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air\" src=\"https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/a476c2e0-9780-11f0-bd4b-d87caa240702\" style=\"height: 1263px; width: 2400px;\" /><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air</figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Engadget</div></figure><h2 id=\"jump-link-display-and-the-crease-question\">Display and the crease question</h2><p>The display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.</p><p>Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-crease-less-foldable-oled-panel-showcased-z-fold-8/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel</a>, which several sources — including <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a> — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.</p><p>According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.</p><p>If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-cameras-and-biometrics\">Cameras and biometrics</h2><p>Camera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:</p><ul><li><p>Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)</p></li><li><p>One punch-hole camera on the outer display</p></li><li><p>One under-display camera on the inner screen</p></li></ul><p>Several sources claim <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple will avoid Face ID</a> entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apple-will-reportedly-bring-back-touch-id-on-a-foldable-iphone-135831748.html\" target=\"_blank\">rely on Touch ID</a> built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.</p><p>Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://wccftech.com/apples-first-foldable-iphone-to-have-a-24-megapixel-under-display-selfie-camera-no-faceid/\" target=\"_blank\">rumored 24MP sensor</a> would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-iphone-folds-hinge-and-materials\">iPhone Fold’s hinge and materials</h2><p>The hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/26/01/14/iphone-folds-titanium-liquid-metal-rumors-just-wont-go-away\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple reports claim Apple will use </a>Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.</p><p>Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.</p><p><a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/youtuber-jon-prosser-posts-foldable-iphone-renders\" target=\"_blank\">Leaks from Jon Prosser</a> also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-battery-and-other-components\">Battery and other components&nbsp;</h2><p>Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&amp;logNo=224077504572&amp;navType=by\" target=\"_blank\">multiple Asian supply-chain reports</a>, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.</p><p>That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.</p><h2 id=\"jump-link-price\">Price</h2><p>None of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\" target=\"_blank\">iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone</a> ever.</p><p>Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. <a class=\"link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,”</a> while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.</p><p>Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch. </p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-design-upgrades-price-and-more-details-130000074.html?src=rss",

AI-assisted live translations are being introduced for Holy Mass attendees — the holy masses if you will. The Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican has teamed up with <a href=\"https://translated.com/english-translation-services?\">Translated</a>, a language service provider, to create live <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-ai-voice-translation-feature-rolls-out-globally-200945034.html\">translations</a> in 60 languages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&quot;Saint Peter’s Basilica has, for centuries, welcomed the faithful from every nation and tongue. In making available a tool that helps many to understand the words of the liturgy, we wish to serve the mission that defines the centre of the Catholic Church, universal by its very vocation,&quot; Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, O.F.M. Conv., Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of Saint Peter in the Vatican, said in a statement. &quot;I am very happy with the collaboration with Translated. In this centenary year, we look to the future with prudence and discernment, confident that human ingenuity, when guided by faith, may become an instrument of communion.&quot;</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>Visitors to the Vatican will have the option to scan a QR code. They will then have access to live audio and text translations of the liturgy. It doesn't require an app and should work right on a web page.</p>\n<p>The technology stems from Lara, a translation AI tool Translated launched in 2024. Translated claims that Lara works with the &quot;sensitivity of over 500,000 native-speaking professional translators.&quot;&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/the-vatican-introduces-an-ai-assisted-live-translation-service-163014907.html?src=rss",

    "description": "<div id=\"c92556da27e14f64b1a498698eec58e0\"></div>\n<p>Bloober Team has revealed <em>Layer of Fear 3</em> following a Valentine's Day countdown that started at the beginning of 2026. The new chapter will include not only a game but a novel and music, the company said in a <a href=\"https://blooberteam.prowly.com/446859-layers-of-fear-3-revealed-bloober-team-is-expanding-its-horror-multiverse-with-new-games-and-cross-media-content\">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The developer revealed the new IP via a live-action teaser, with an actor reading lines from William Blake's poem, <em>The Sick Rose</em>. A painting then fell from the wall, and the actor then turned over an hourglass with red sand, with a tagline stating &quot;The door won't stay closed.&quot; No gameplay or other information like the release date was revealed.</p>\n<span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span><p>What Bloober did say, though, is that it would launch new <em>Layer of Fear</em> non-game content, including a novel by horror writer, poet and vocalist Marta Bijan. The company also announced that it would release the soundtracks for <em>Layer of Fear,</em> <em>The Medium</em> and <em>Cronos</em> both in digital and physical (CD and vinyl) editions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The new title is likely to be eagerly anticipated given Bloober's form of late. The company recently released its <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/gaming/cronos-the-new-dawn-seems-to-smush-dead-space-and-control-together-in-a-good-way-172611962.html\"><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></a> and a new Switch 2 <em>Layers of Fear 2</em> version called <em>Layers of Fear: The Final Masterpiece Edition</em>. The original <em>Layers of Fear</em> <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-25-layers-of-fear-valentines-day-love-horror.html\">came out back in 2016</a> and is considered one of the better horror titles of recent years, thanks to an expertly crafted narrative and psychedelic thrills and chills. The sequel moved to a creepy ocean liner and was equally well-received.</p>\n<p><strong>Update Feb. 16, 2026 at 3:06PM ET</strong>: The headline was updated with the correct game name.&nbsp;</p>This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/layers-of-3-revealed-via-a-mysterious-trailer-and-poem-153021903.html?src=rss",

The new Nano charger with smart display, which is an upgrade to the existing Nano charger in Anker's lineup, is on sale for $30 right now. That's $10 off the regular price.</p> \n<p>The 45W charger includes a smart display that shows real-time data like power flow, temperature and charging status. It also features \"fun animations to keep things cheerful.\" Anker says it can recognize what's being charged and automatically adjust certain metrics to ensure a longer battery lifespan.</p> <span id=\"end-legacy-contents\"></span>\n<p>To that end, it works with just about everything. The company advertises that this charger is a good fit for the iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods and Samsung devices, among others.
